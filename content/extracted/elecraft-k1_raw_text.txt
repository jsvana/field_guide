1. Introduction
The K1 is a versatile, low-power CW transceiver that covers two
or four builder-selected HF bands. It provides 5 watts or more of
power output; excellent receiver sensitivity and selectivity; and
many useful operating features, including instant band selection,
receive and transmit incremental tuning (RIT/XIT), digital
display, configuration menu, and multiple crystal filter
bandwidths.
With receive-mode current drain of about 55 mA, built-in keyer,
and a stable, low-frequency VFO, the K1 is ideal for portable
operation. It's also one of the smallest multi-band HF transceivers
available–smaller than many single-band rigs. And, when used with
the optional wide-range tilt stand (KTS1), the K1 is truly trail-
friendly. The tilt stand comes with long arms for ground-mounting
(see below), as well as shorter arms for desk-top use.
Like our all-band K2 transceiver, the K1 uses modular construction,
allowing it to adapt to your operating needs. The Filter board covers
either two (KFL1-2) or four (KFL1-4) bands, and a different Filter
board can be swapped in at any time. There are two plug-in options,
including a noise blanker (KNB1) and automatic antenna tuner
(KAT1). There's also an internal AA-cell battery option (KBT1).
These options can be installed easily at any time.
The K1's modular assembly will also appeal to first-time builders.
The kit requires almost no point-to-point wiring, unlike earlier
designs that used wiring harnesses. The K1 even provides its own
built-in test equipment, including battery voltage monitor,
wattmeter, and frequency counter. The manual provides complete
troubleshooting and signal tracing procedures, and you’ll find further
support on our website, www.elecraft.com.
We’d like to thank you for choosing the K1 transceiver, and hope it
meets your expectations for operation both at home and in the field.

3. Preparation for Assembly
Overview of the K1
The K1 uses modular design for ease of assembly and
troubleshooting. The chassis is made up of five pieces (Figure 3-1),
any of which can be removed individually. The RF power amplifier
transistor uses the right side panel as a heat sink, so there is no
separate heat sink element. Each side panel includes a 10-32
threaded PEM nut as a mounting point for the KTS1 tilt stand.

There are three printed circuit boards (PCBs), as shown in
Figure 3-2: Front Panel board, Filter board, and RF board. These
boards plug in together with no wiring, as explained in the next
section. K1 options, such as the KNB1 noise blanker, also plug in
directly. Appendix D shows photographs of each completed PC
board assembly.

Board-to-board Connectors
The circuit boards in the K1 plug in together using board-to-board connectors, which eliminates nearly all hand wiring. Gold-plated contacts
are used on these connectors for reliability and corrosion resistance.
Figure 3-3 shows a side view of the PC boards and board-to-board connectors. As can be seen in the drawing, the Front Panel board has a
connector J1 which mates with right-angle connector P1 on the RF board. The Filter board has three connectors, P1, P2 and P3, which mate
with J6, J7 and J8 on the RF board.
These multi-pin connectors are difficult to remove once soldered in place. Refer to Figure 3-3 during assembly to make sure
you have each connector placed correctly before soldering. If you install a multi-pin connector incorrectly, clip all of the pins at
the body of the device first, remove all of the pins individually, and call us to request a new connector. You may damage pads
and traces by trying to remove such components intact.

Unpacking and Inventory
Handling Integrated Circuits and Transistors
This kit uses integrated circuits (ICs) and transistors that
can be damaged by electrostatic discharge (ESD). Problems
caused by ESD can often be difficult to troubleshoot. To
avoid this:
 
Leave parts in their anti-static packaging until you install them
 
Use an anti-static mat on your work bench
 
Use a soldering iron with a grounded tip
 
Ground yourself using a wrist strap with 1-Mohm series resistor
 
At minimum, touch an unpainted, grounded metal surface
before handling ESD-sensitive components
Inventory
We recommend that you do a complete inventory, using the parts
lists in Appendix A. Start with the K1 Packing Box Parts list,
which details the items you should find when you first open the
box. Additional parts lists are provided for components used in each
subassembly. Component photographs are provided in most cases.
Identifying Resistors and RF Chokes
Resistor and RF choke values and color bands are provided in the
text. However, it's helpful to familiarize yourself with the color
code. The color-code chart, Figure 3-4, shows how to read the four
color bands on 5% resistors. For example, a 1,500 ohm (1.5 k) 5%
resistor has color bands BROWN, GREEN, RED and GOLD.
1% resistors are similar, but use five bands: three significant digits, a
multiplier, and tolerance. The first four bands on a 1.5 k, 1%
resistor are BROWN, GREEN, BLACK, BROWN. The multiplier
value is 1 rather than 2 in the this case because of the third
significant digit. 1% resistors have color bands that are sometimes
hard to distinguish clearly; use an ohmmeter to identify them.
The markings on RF chokes reflect their value in microhenries
(µH), using two significant digits and a multiplier. Example: a choke
with color bands RED, VIOLET, BLACK has value of 27 µH.

Identifying Capacitors
Small-value fixed capacitors are usually marked with one, two, or
three digits and no decimal point. If one or two digits are used, that
is the value in picofarads (pF). If there are three digits, the third
digit is a multiplier. For example, a capacitor marked "151" would
be 150 pF (15 with a multiplier of 101). Similarly, "330" would be
33 pF, and "102" would be 1000 pF (or .001 µF). Exceptions are
described specifically in the text and parts list.
Fixed capacitors with values of 1000 pF or higher often use a
decimal point in the value, such as .001, .047, or 2.2. This is the
value in microfarads (µF). (1 µF is equal to 1,000,000 pF.)
Tools
The following specialized tools are supplied with the K1:
 
.050" (1.3 mm) and 5/64" (2 mm) Allen wrenches
 
Double-ended plastic alignment tool
In addition to the tools supplied, you will need these standard tools:
 
Temperature-controlled soldering iron, 700-800°F (370-430°C)
 
Fine-point soldering iron tip, approx. .05" (spade type)
 
Small-diameter, IC-grade solder (see Solder Recommendations)
 
Desoldering tools (wick, solder-sucker, etc.)
 
Needle-nose pliers
 
Small-point diagonal cutters, preferably flush-cutting
 
Small Phillips and flat-blade screwdrivers
 
DMM (digital multimeter; do not use an analog VOM)
 
Magnifying glass
We strongly recommend that you use a conductive wrist strap and
anti-static mat during assembly. These items are available at very
low cost from Jameco, Mouser, and other electronics suppliers.
Soldering and Desoldering
Use adequate ventilation when soldering, and avoid
inhaling smoke or fumes. Always wash your hands after
handling solder, as lead residue is highly toxic.
Solder Recommendations
We recommend small-diameter (.02 to .04") rosin-core solder,
similar to Kester type 44. Solder with 2% silver is used by some
builders and will work equally well. If you use a minimum of solder,
there will be no need to clean PC boards. The use of acid-core
solder, water-soluble flux solder, or any corrosive or conductive flux
or solvent is likely to damage components and/or PC boards.
Soldering
When applying solder, use the minimum amount required to
surround the component lead and make good contact with its
printed-circuit pad. You don't need a "fillet" (build-up) of solder.
To provide a good connection, the solder must flow onto both the
component lead and its PC board pad. To ensure that both will be
heated at the same time, the tip of the iron should contact both the
component lead and the PC board pad before solder is applied.
Solder joints should be clean and shiny. If a joint appears dull or has
fine cracks, it is probably cold. Cold solder joints should be cleaned
and re-soldered. First, use solder wick (desoldering braid) to remove
the old solder. Then apply fresh solder. If you have many cold
solder joints, it probably indicates that your soldering iron
temperature is too low, or that the tip or solder itself is defective.
New soldering iron tips must be tinned before they’re used. Allow
the iron to warm up completely, then apply solder and allow it to
coat the entire tip. After a few minutes, wipe off the excess solder.
Use a sponge for wiping the iron tip, and clean the sponge often.

============================================================
PAGE 11
============================================================

    ELECRAFT
Desoldering
The printed circuit boards used in the kit are double-sided, meaning
that they have circuitry on both sides. The component mounting
holes are plated-through to complete electrical connections
between the two sides.
Removing components from double-sided boards can be difficult,
since you must get all of the solder back out of the hole before a
lead can be removed. To do this, you'll need solder wick
(desoldering braid) and/or a vacuum desoldering tool. It also takes
some practice. A number of suggestions are provided below.
The best strategy for avoiding de-soldering is to place all
components properly the first time. Double-check values
and orientations, and avoid damaging parts via ESD.
When removing components:
 
Don't pull a lead or pin out of a hole unless the solder has been
removed, or you are applying heat. Otherwise, you can literally
pull out the plating on the plated-through hole.
 
Limit soldering iron contact to a few seconds at a time.
 
Use small-size solder-wick, about 0.1" or 2.5 mm wide. Use the
wick on both the top and bottom pads when possible. This
helps get all of the solder out of the hole.
 
If you use a vacuum desoldering tool (solder sucker), use a large
unit. Small solder suckers are not very effective.
 
The safest way to remove ICs and other components with more
than 3 leads is to clip all of the pins at the body of the device
first, then remove all of the pins individually. You may damage
pads and traces by trying to remove such components intact.
 
Invest in a PC board vice with a heavy base if possible. This
makes parts removal easier because it frees up both hands.
If in doubt about a particular repair, ask for advice from Elecraft or
from someone else with PCB repair experience.
Assembly Notes
Each step in the assembly process is accompanied by a check-box:
This symbol is used to alert you to important information:
i
Do not skip any steps. You may adversely affect both the
performance and appearance of the kit by using the wrong
assembly order.
Components
Sometimes we refer to components by their PC board and reference
designator. For example, "FP-Q1" refers to transistor Q1 on the
Front Panel board.
A few components in the kit are mounted on the bottom of PC
boards. Component outline symbols are provided on the
appropriate side of the board, so it will always be clear which side a
particular component goes on. Bottom-mounted parts are also
identified on the schematics by this symbol:
Photographs
Before beginning assembly, you should review the photographs in
Appendix D to get an idea of what the completed PC boards look
like. You'll also find front and back views of each PC board in the
Parts Placement Drawings, Appendix F.

4. Filter Board
This section applies only to the two-band K1 Filter board. If
you have a four-band K1, refer to the assembly instructions
in the KFL1-4 manual.
The Filter board determines the K1's bands of operation.
A photograph of the completed board appears in Appendix D.
 Open the bag of components labeled KFL-2 and
sort the parts into groups. Identify components using the
photographs in the Filter board parts list in Appendix A.
 Locate the Filter printed circuit board (PCB), labeled "K1
FIL2" on one side.
With the top side of the PC board facing you (notch at the
lower right), locate the position of resistor R1, along the front
edge. The label "R1" appears just left of the resistor’s outline.
 Install a 100-ohm, 5% resistor (brown-black-brown) at R1,
with its first color band (brown) toward the left. Make sure it is
seated flat on the board, then bend the leads outward at about a 45-
degree angle to hold it in place.
 Solder R1 on the bottom of the board. Trim the leads as close
as possible to the solder joints.
i
  Components may be soldered one at a time or in groups.
Leads can be trimmed either before or after soldering.
Install an 18-pin IC socket at U1, with the notched end of the
socket oriented towards the "K1 FIL2" label. Bend two leads of the
socket outward slightly to hold it in place while soldering. (U1 itself
will be installed in a later step.)
i
  In the following steps you'll install three relays (K1-K3).
Relay pins must not be bent, even after placement on the PC board,
as this may cause unreliable mechanical operation.
Place relays K1-K3 on the top side of the board. One end of
each relay has a heavy line printed across the top to indicate the
pin 1 end. This end must be matched with the same end of the
relay’s PC board outline. Do not solder the relays yet.
 When all three relays have been placed on the board, lay a flat
object such as a book or piece of cardboard on top of the relays to
keep them in place, then flip the board over.
 Solder only two pins (at opposite corners) on each relay, using
a minimum amount of solder. Limit soldering time to 2 or 3
seconds per pin. Do not bend or trim the leads.
 Turn the board back over and verify that all of the relays are
in the correct orientation and are seated flat on the board. To
check the orientation, refer to the Filter board drawing in
Appendix F, at the bottom of the page.
 Solder all of the remaining relay pins. Do not bend or trim the
leads.

    ELECRAFT
 Install the capacitors listed below. The list shows the
capacitance value, followed by the labeling (in parentheses). After
installing each capacitor, bend the leads outward at about a 45-
degree angle to hold it in place until it is soldered and trimmed.
__ C29, .001 (102) 
__ C30, .001 (102)
__ C27, .047 (473)
 Place a bookmark at this page, and another at the
Per-Band Components table in Appendix A.
 Locate the two bags of per-band components, which are
labeled by band, e.g. "40m" or "K1B40" (40 meters).
 Under Reference Designators in the Per-Band Components
table, there are Band 1 and Band 2 columns. Fill in the blanks at
the top with your two bands (e.g., "40" and "20"). The lower-
frequency band should be designated as Band 1.
 Using strips of paper, or labels with a light adhesive such as
“post-its,” temporarily cover the band 2 reference designators
column. Similarly, cover all of the components columns except the
column associated with band 1. This is a very important step
that will eliminate possible confusion during assembly.
 Open the bag of components for band 1 only, setting the
band 2 components aside for now.
i
  The leads on small capacitors may be pre-formed so that
the capacitor sits slightly above the board when inserted; this will
not affect performance. The leads are also somewhat fragile.
 Install the capacitors for band 1, using the reference
designators and values from the appropriate columns in the parts
list. For example, if band 1 is 40 meters, install 390-pF capacitors
at C1 and C5, then 330 pF capacitors at C2 and C4, etc. Double-
check each capacitor value as it is installed. Do not solder yet.
 Solder all of the band 1 capacitors.
 At this point you’ll need to choose whether to set up the VFO
for 80-kHz or 150-kHz coverage (approx.). The smaller range
covers the most-used portion of every band, provides smoother
tuning, and is strongly recommended if you plan to upgrade to the
four-band module (KFL1-4), which has narrower band-pass filters.
Record your VFO range selection here for reference:
___ 80 kHz
___ 150 kHz
Note: Two different crystals are supplied for 30 meters,
corresponding to two different lower band edges. Which one to use
depends on your selected VFO range (see below). In the following
steps you’ll select one of the two crystals when applicable.
Band
VFO Range
Crystal
Band Edge
80 kHz
18.100
10.100
30 Meters
150 kHz
18.000
10.000
 If band 1 is 30 meters, select the appropriate crystal using the
table above. Save the other crystal for possible future use.
Install the band 1 crystal at X1 on the filter board (to the right
of X2), bending the leads to hold it in place. Make sure the crystal is
seated correctly, then solder. Use a minimum amount of solder to
avoid a short under the can.
 Move the strips of paper or labels that you used earlier so that
they cover the band 1 reference designators column, and all of the
components columns except the column associated with band 2.
 Open the components bag for band 2. Install the band 2
capacitors, using the reference designators and values from the
appropriate columns as before. (Example: if band 2 is 20 meters,
you'll install 180-pF capacitors at C6 and C10, etc.)
 Locate the band 2 crystal and verify that it is the correct
frequency. If band 2 is 30 meters, select one of the two crystals
supplied (see table above). Install it at X2 and solder.

holes provided near X1 and X2. Fold each wire over the top of the
crystal and solder it on top. Keep soldering time below 5 seconds at
a time; if it takes longer, your iron may not be hot enough, or your
iron tip may not be making good contact with the crystal can.
Solder and trim the wires on the bottom of the board.

 Install the ceramic resonator, Z1, to the right of U1. (The
ceramic resonator looks like a capacitor with three pins, and can be
oriented in either direction.) Limit soldering time to 2 or 3 seconds
on each pin to avoid altering the oscillation frequency.
 Locate the eight 1-µH slug-tuned inductors, and make sure
they are all have a red stripe or are labeled "T1050".
 Install the inductors at L1 through L8, pressing each one down
as far as it will go. They have five pins, plus ground tabs, and can
only be installed on the board one way. Solder the inductors.
 At the left and right ends of the board you’ll find two short
jumper locations, each labeled with a ground symbol (
). Use
component leads to make 3/4" (19 mm) U-shaped wires for each
jumper (Figure 4-2). Solder the jumpers on the bottom of the board,
with the top of the U-shape approx. 1/4" (6 mm) above the board.

Identifying Toroid Cores
Several toroidal inductors are used in the K1, including four on the
Filter board. It is important to use the correct type of core. This
can be determined from the color and size.
The cores used on the Filter board are type T37-6. The T identifies
an iron-powder core. The number following the T specifies the
outside diameter in hundredths of an inch, in this case 0.37 inches
(9.4 mm). The suffix (-6) refers to a specific mix of iron powder,
which uses a particular color, in this case yellow.
Later in assembly you'll encounter ferrite cores, for example type
FT50-43. In this part number, FT identifies the core as ferrite, and
50 is the size (0.50", 12.5 mm). The suffix (-43) identifies the type
of ferrite used, although all ferrite cores are dark gray in color. All
ferrite cores used in the K1 are of the -43 type.

  In the following steps you’ll install toroidal inductors L9-
L12 (type T37-6 cores). They must be wound as indicated in the
instructions, or the transceiver will not operate correctly. Use only
the number of turns specified. It is not necessary to attempt to
precisely match the inductances specified in the parts list.
Find the component outline for L9 on the Filter board.
Compare this component outline to Figure 4-3, which shows two
views of a typical toroidal inductor. L9 will be mounted vertically
as shown at the right side of the drawing, with one wire exiting at
the core’s upper left, and the other at the lower right. There are
pads on the PC board in these two locations.
Using the Per-Band Components parts table (Band 1),
determine the number of turns and wire length for L9 and L10.
To wind L9, cut the specified length of #26 red enamel-coated
wire, then "sew" the long end of the wire through the core. Each
pass through the core counts as one turn. The finished winding
should look similar to Figure 4-3, but with the number of turns
indicated in the parts list. Figure 4-3 shows 14 turns.
Remove insulation
Figure 4-3
 Verify that the turns of L9 are not bunched together. They
should be evenly spaced, and should occupy about 80-90% of the
core.
Stripping Toroid Leads
The enamel wire supplied with the kit can be heat-stripped. One
way to do this is to place a small amount of solder (a "blob") on the
end of your soldering iron, then insert the wire into the hot solder.
If the iron is hot enough, you should see the insulation vaporize
after 3 to 6 seconds. Another possibility is to burn the insulation
off by heating it with a small butane lighter for a few seconds, then
use fine-grain sandpaper to remove the enamel residue. Avoid
scraping insulation off with a razor blade, as this may nick the wire.
 Strip the leads of L9, as explained above. You should remove
the enamel from the leads up to about 1/8" (3 mm) from the core
(Figure 4-3).
 Tin L9's leads. The solder should appear clean and shiny. If it
looks dull or is not adhering very well to the bare lead, there is
probably some insulation remaining. Remove it as described above.
 Install L9 vertically as shown by its component outline. Pull
the leads taut on the bottom of the board.
 Solder the leads of L9. When soldering, make sure that the
solder binds well to the leads. If the lead appears to be an "island" in
a small pool of solder, chances are it is not making good contact.
 Wind and install L10 in the same manner as L9, using the
same number of turns. Install L10 vertically, to the right of L9.
 Wind and install L11 and L12. Use the Per-Band Components
table (Band 2) to look up the wire length and number of turns.
i
  Do not use adhesives or fixatives of any kind to secure L9-
L12 to the PC board. They will be adequately held to the board by
their leads alone.

  The connectors to be installed in the following steps
must be positioned correctly to avoid intermittent or
unreliable operation.
Before attempting to install multi-pin connectors, review the
information on page 7.
Install an 8-pin male connector (plug) at P1, but do not solder
yet. Figure 4-4 shows P1 as viewed from the left end of the Filter
board. The plastic part of the connector must be on the bottom
side of the board, with the long end of the pins pointed down. The
short pins are inserted into the board.
P1
Figure 4-4
Solder just one of the middle pins of P1, on the top side.
Note: multi-pin connectors have plastic bodies that can melt if too
much heat is applied, causing the pins to be mis-positioned. Limit
soldering time for each pin to 2 to 3 seconds.
Examine the placement of P1 closely. If it is tilted or is not
flat against the board, re-heat the solder while pressing down on the
connector.
Once P1 is in the right position, solder the remaining pins. Do
not trim the leads.
Install P2 and P3 in the same manner as P1. Before soldering,
verify that each connector is flat against the board and not tilted.
Cut a 1" (25 mm) length of insulated hookup wire. Strip about
1/8" (3 mm) of insulation off of each end.

Locate the blank white area near U1. This area is provided for 
labeling the Filter board with the two bands covered (e.g. "40, 20").  
Use an indelible marker, dry transfers, or an adhesive label. 
 
Uninstalled Components 
All component locations on the Filter board should now be filled 
except J1 and J2, which are provided for the automatic antenna tuner 
(KAT1). The KAT1 option should be installed only after the basic K1 
kit has been completed and tested. At that time, the jumper you 
installed between pins 2 and 10 of J2 will be removed. If you’re 
building a 2-band Filter board that includes 80 meters, you’ll have a 
10 µF electrolytic capacitor left over at this point. This will be 
installed on the RF board at C78 in a later step.  
 
Visual Inspection 
Using the parts placement drawings in Appendix F, re-check the 
orientation of the relays (K1, K2, K3) and U1. 
i
  About 90% of all problems with kits are caused by poorly-
soldered component leads. Such problems can be avoided by doing a 
careful inspection of the board, preferably with a magnifying glass. 
Examine the bottom of the PC board closely for cold solder joints, 
solder bridges, and unsoldered components. 
 Resistance Checks 
 Make the measurements listed below, touching the meter's (+) 
and (-) leads to the indicated points. Measurements at relay K3 must 
be made on the bottom side. Relay pins are numbered like ICs, with 
pin 1 identified by its round pad. The Filter board schematic (in

 Install S3, once again using the switch spacing tool to adjust
the switch height. When soldering S3, be careful not to contact the
plastic body of J1 with the soldering iron.
 Install switches S2, S4, S5, and S6 using the same technique.
Note: Switch caps will be installed later.
 Install these parts on the top side of the board. Solder them on
the bottom side, using a minimum of solder.
__ R8, 22 (RED-RED-BLK)
__ C4, .047 µF (473)
 Trim the leads of R8 and C4 as close to the board as possible
so that they won't interfere with the 40-pin IC socket (next step).
 Install the 40-pin IC socket at U1, on the bottom side of the
board. The board is labeled "SOCKET" at this location. Orient the
socket's notched end to the left (the pin 1 end). To hold the socket
in place, bend pins 1 and 21 outward slightly; these two pins are
diagonally opposite. Solder only these two pins.
 If the socket does not appear to be seated flat on the PC
board, reheat these two pins while pressing on the socket. If the
leads of C4 hit the socket, trim them closer to the board.
 Solder the remaining pins of U1. (U1 itself will be installed in
the socket in a later step.)
 Install and solder the following components. When soldering
components near the push-button switches, be careful not to touch
the switches with the soldering iron.

 Install capacitors C1 and C2 (82 pF), near U1.
 Locate resistor network RP1. ("RP" means "resistor pack,"
another name for resistor networks.) One end of RP1 has a band or dot,
indicating pin 1. RP1 should be labeled 77083102, 83C102, or
8A3102G. If the labeling differs, verify the resistance. You should
measure about 1.0 k between each pair of adjacent pins.
 Install RP1 on the bottom side of the board. The end with a
dot or bar should be oriented towards pin 1 of the PCB outline.
When soldering RP1, keep the iron tip away from S4 and S5.

  Before handling ICs and transistors in the following steps,
touch an unpainted, grounded metal surface.
 Locate transistor Q1 (type 2N4124), which has a small, 3-lead
TO-92 package. Q1 and other TO-92 devices may have either of
the two shapes shown in Figure 5-4. The right-hand illustration
shows a "modified TO-92" package, which may be labeled on either
the front or back side. The large flat side of each device will be
aligned with the flat side of its component outline.
Figure 5-4
 Install Q1 on the bottom side of the board, to the right of the
large hole. Align Q1 as shown above. The transistor should be
mounted about 1/8" (3 mm) above the board; don’t force it down
too far or you may break the leads. Bend the leads outward slightly
to hold Q1 in place, then solder and trim the leads.
 Locate U4, a 78L06 voltage regulator, which has a TO-92
package similar to Q1. Install U4 below the large hole.
i
  Touch an unpainted, grounded metal surface before
handling the 2N7000 transistor in the next two steps.
 Locate the component outline for Q2 (2N7000) on the top
side of the board near the rectangular hole. Q2's outline has the
three pins side-by-side, not in a triangular pattern. Pre-form the
leads of Q2 to match this hole pattern, so that it can be mounted
very close to the PC board with little excess lead length.
 Install Q2. Make sure the top of Q2's body is no more
than 0.25" (6 mm) above the board when seated. Solder Q2.
 Install the 8-pin ICs, U2 (MAX518), U3 (24LC04), and U5
(LM358) on the bottom side. Orient the notched or dimpled end of
each IC with the notched end of its component outline (see Figure
4-7). Bend two leads outward slightly on the opposite side of the
board to hold the devices in place, but do not solder yet.
 Turn to Appendix F (parts placement drawings) to verify that
you have the ICs installed in the proper locations, then solder.
Limit soldering time to 2 to 3 seconds on each lead.
 On the top side of the board at the left end you’ll find a short
jumper location, labeled with a ground symbol (
). Install a 3/4"
(19 mm) U-shaped wire here, as you did earlier on the Filter board.
i
  The potentiometers to be installed in the next step can be
damaged if you push on their plastic shafts. When seating a
potentiometer, press down only on the metal frame.
 Install the two 10-k potentiometers at R2 and R3 (on the top

frame is fully contacting the PC board on both sides. Do not use
excessive heat when soldering.

To the right of X1 you'll find a ground pad for the crystal can.
Use a discarded component lead to make the grounding wire, as

Locate LEDs D1 and D2, which are identical in size but have
different-colored bodies. D1 has a clear diffuse body, while D2 has a
yellow tint. Near the point where the leads exit the body, you'll find
a flat side in the plastic, which identifies the cathode lead.
Install D1 (clear diffuse body) on the top side of the board,
with its flat side aligned with the flat side of  the component
outline. (This is the side nearest the square pad.) Position D1 about
1/16" (1.5 mm) above the board. You can use the switch-spacing
tool, a toothpick, or short length of insulated hookup wire to
maintain the proper spacing while soldering.

visible through the countersunk panel hole just below R1. Secure the
panel to the standoff with a 3/16" (4.8 mm) flat-head screw.

  Caution: The 10-turn potentiometer may have a
plastic bushing. In the following step, do not over-tighten
the nut or you may strip the threads.
 Use the nut and lock washer supplied with R1 to secure it to
the front panel. It should be just tight enough to keep R1 from
rotating.
 Place the large knob on R1's shaft. Push the knob on until it
just touches the bushing. If the knob does not spin freely, move it
out slightly. If the shaft or knob appears to be tilted, the large
nylon washer may not be positioned correctly (behind the panel).
i
  The Allen wrenches are located in a small bag with the
MISCELLANEOUS items. These wrenches may have been oiled
during manufacturing. Remove the wrenches and wipe off the oil, if
any, then discard the bag.
 Use the larger Allen wrench (5/64" [2 mm]) to tighten the two
set screws on the large knob.
 Set the AF GAIN and RIT/XIT potentiometers to midway in
their rotation, and place a small knob on each. Do not push down
hard on the knobs, as this may damage the potentiometers.
 Tighten each knob's two set screws using the smaller Allen
wrench (.050" [1.3 mm]). Align the pointers per panel labeling.
i
  At this point in the assembly, the push-button switches
may not all protrude an equal distance. The switch height will
become equalized once the front panel assembly is mated to the RF
board in a later step.
i
  When you rotate the VFO knob, you may hear a faint
sound produced by the wiper of the 10-turn potentiometer as it
moves across its resistance element. This is normal.

top side of the board with 3/16" (4.8 mm) pan-head screws and #4
split lock washers (Figure 6-3b).
Make sure that the 2-D fasteners line up with the edges of the
PC board and do not hang over. If they hang over or do not match
their component outlines, they are installed backwards.
 Install relay K1, near the center of the board. Make sure the
pin 1 end (with the heavy line) is oriented as indicated by K1’s
component outline. Do not bend or trim the relay leads.
i
  In the steps that follow you’ll install the connectors that
mate with the Filter and Front Panel boards. These connectors
must be installed properly to ensure reliable mechanical connection.
They are difficult to remove once installed, so follow all
instructions carefully. Review Figure 3-3 before proceeding.
 Install an 8-pin female connector at J6, on the top side of the
RF board. It must be flush with the board and not tilted (Figure 6-4).
Solder just one pin near the center of J6.
J6

 If J6 does not appear to be completely flush with the board, or
it is tilted, re-heat the soldered pin and press down. Do not solder
the remaining pins yet.
 Install J7 and J8 in the same manner as J6, soldering just one
pin in each case.
 The Filter board can now be used to check for proper
installation of the three 8-pin connectors. Place the Filter board
above the connectors (do not plug it in). Verify that all pins of P1,
2, and 3 on the Filter board align with the corresponding holes of
J6, 7 and 8 on the RF board.
 Remove the Filter board. Solder all remaining pins of J6, 7,
and 8 on the bottom of the RF board.

  In the steps that follow, you'll be installing larger groups of
components. When working from a long list, install all of the items
on one line before moving on to the next. Arrows (⇒) appear in
the list to remind you of this order. In general, assembly proceeds
from left to right across the board.
Note: All components mounted in the T-R switch and transmitter
areas must be kept as low-profile as possible since the Filter board
will be plugged in directly above.

front edge of the board. (Orange bands may appear to be brown.)
 Install a 100-µH RF choke (BRN-BLK-BRN) at RFC4, in the
transmit area of the board.
 The ceramic trimmer capacitors (C13 and C20) have one side
that is flattened. This side must be oriented towards the flattened
side of the component outline. Install C20 near the front edge of
the board, and C13 in the back-left corner.
 Sort the diodes into groups for identification purposes. You
should have two types of small glass-bodied diodes: 1N5711, and
1N4148. The 1N4753 zener diode may also be glass, and is larger.
If necessary, use a magnifying glass to read the labels.
i
  Diodes with long axial leads (such as the types mentioned
above) must be installed with the banded end (cathode) oriented
towards the banded end of their component outlines. If a diode has
more than one band, the widest band indicates the cathode end.
Install 1N4148 diodes at D17 and D1, observing the proper
orientation as explained above. Do not solder yet. D17 and D1 are
both near RP2, in the VFO area.
Install 1N5711 diodes at D2 and D15, but do not solder yet. D2
is in the VFO area. D15 is in the back-right corner near J8.
Re-check the orientation of the diodes, then solder.
Identify the two types of black, axial-lead diodes: 1N4007 and
SB530. The 1N4007 is the smaller of the two.
Install the SB530 diode at D16, near the back edge of the

Install 1N4007 diodes at D11 and D10, to the left of D16.
Install a 1N4007 diode at D5, near J7.
The varactor diodes have a small plastic package, like a TO-92
transistor, but with only two leads. Sort the varactor diodes into
two types: MV209 (quantity 1) and 1SV149 or V149SL (quantity 4).
Install the varactor diodes listed below. The flat side of each
diode must match the flat side of its PC board outline. Bend the
leads slightly on the bottom to hold the diodes in place.
__ D4, MV209

 Install C8 (82 pF) on the bottom of the board, near P1.
Before soldering, fold it down against the board, towards the back.
 On the top and bottom sides of the board near J7 you’ll find
short jumpers (

 Locate the DC power switch, S1. Install S1 near the back of
the board, with the plunger facing the back edge. Make sure S1 is
pressed firmly onto the board, and that it is not tilted.
 Push the black keycap onto S1’s plunger until it snaps.
 Install the DC input jack, J4, at the back edge. The 3 leads on
the jack must be lined up with the slot-shaped holes in the
component outline. If the holes are a tight fit, press firmly until
the connector snaps into position, flat against the board.
Visual Inspection
 Verify correct orientation (banded end) of each diode installed
so far, using the parts placement drawing (Appendix F).
 Examine both sides of the PC board closely for solder bridges,
cold solder joints, or unsoldered components.
Resistance Checks
 Make the resistance checks listed below, with your DMM's (-)

 Locate the component outline for RFC8, on the bottom of the RF 
board in the transmitter area. Install a short wire jumper at RFC8, 
formed from a component lead or solid hookup wire.  
Note: an RF choke may be supplied with the 80-meter band kit (2-
band Filter board only) for use at RFC8. This RF choke can be 
installed at any time, and will have no effect on K1 alignment or 
testing on any band. Its function is to improve stability on 80 meters 
when the K1 is used with poorly-matched loads or an ATU. 
DC Voltage Checks 
 Set power switch S1 to its OFF position, with the plunger out 
(extended toward the back). 
 Connect a 12 to 14-V DC power supply or battery to J4. If your 
power source does not already have a plug that mates with J4, use the

lead of the plug is positive (+). 
 Turn on S1. If you see or smell smoke, or a component feels 
hot to the touch, disconnect the power source immediately. Locate 
the source of trouble before proceeding. 
 Using your DMM's DC voltage setting, make the DC voltage

 Turn the K1 off and disconnect the power supply. 
 Install the headphone jack, J2, on the small board extension near 
the front-left corner. The pins on J2 are not very long, so they will be 
nearly flush with the bottom of the board. Solder the pin closest to the 
front edge first (ground), then verify that the jack is seated flat on its 
plastic nubs before soldering the other pins. 
 
Mono Headphones: If you plan to use only a mono plug at J2, cut the 
trace marked "cut = mono" on the bottom of the board, under J2. 
(You'll lose the sound on one side of stereo headphones.) 
 Install the key jack, J3, at the back-left corner. Before soldering, 
make sure that the jack is aligned with its PC board outline. 
 Install the antenna jack, J5 (BNC), in the back-right corner. 
Solder one of the large ground mounting pins first. If J5 then appears 
to be tilted or twisted, reheat this ground pin while pushing J5 down 
onto the board. Once it is seated properly, solder the remaining pins.  
 The internal speaker connector, P2, is a 2-pin connector with a 
locking tab. Orient P2 as shown by its PC board outline, near the 
front-right corner of the board, with the locking tab facing the front. 
P2 must be seated flat against the board before soldering. 
 Install crystal X5, near the front edge of the board. Make sure it 
is flat against the board and not tilted before soldering. (The leads can 
be bent to hold it in place.) 
 Install X6 near the back-left corner. 
 Install X1-X4 at the front-right corner. 
 Ground the cases of all six crystals, using the near-by ground

two terminals closest to J5). 
 On the bottom of the board, install R4 (5.6 k, GRN-BLUE-RED). 
 Locate the miniature slide switch, S2. Install S2 on the bottom of 
the board, with the switch pressed down onto the board as far as it will 
go. (If it isn't pressed all the way down, the actuator might hit the 
bottom panel.) Limit soldering time on each of S2's pins to 2 seconds

 Locate the dark gray (ferrite)  toroid cores. You should have
four smaller cores (type FT37-43) and one larger core (FT50-43).
The three inductors to be wound in the following steps, L2, T1, and
T2, all use the smaller ferrite cores.
i
  Review the toroid winding and lead preparation instructions
if necessary (page 14).
 Wind L2 using 16 turns of red enamel wire (11 inches, 28 cm).
L2 should appear similar to Figure 4-3, on page 14 (the figure
shows 14 turns rather than 16). Recall that each pass of the wire
through the core counts as one turn.
 Prepare L2's leads as before (page 14). Remove the insulation
to within about 1/8" (3 mm) of the core, then tin the leads.
 Install L2 vertically, at the back edge of the RF board between
the on-off switch (S1) and the antenna jack (J5).
i
  T1 is a toroidal transformer, with two numbered windings.
These numbers are printed next to each pad on the PC board. T1's
windings are 1-2 and 3-4.
 T1 is wound on an FT37-43 ferrite core (dark gray) and has
windings similar to those shown in Figure 6-8a. Wind the 3-4
winding first, using 20 turns of red enamel wire (13", 33 cm). This
winding should occupy 80 to 90% of the core. Note: the drawing
shows only 14 turns.
 Wind the 1-2 winding on top of the 3-4 winding, using 4 turns
of green enamel wire (6", 16 cm). These turns should be wound
tightly, and will overlap the turns of the first winding. (The drawing
shows the turns interleaved, for clarity, but this is not required.)
 Strip and tin all four of T1's leads carefully.
 Install T1 flat against the board, between U1 and U2. Insert
the leads into its numbered holes as shown by the component
outline. Pull the leads taut on the bottom, then solder and trim.

 T2 is wound on the same core type as T1. Start with the
3–4 winding, which uses 20 turns of red enamel wire (13", 33 cm).
The 1-2 winding uses 5 turns of green enamel wire (6", 16 cm).
 Strip and tin T2's leads.
 Install T2  flat against the board, to the right of U2. Pull the
leads taut, then solder.
 Using your DMM, check for continuity between the pads of
L2. If the DMM doesn't indicate a short (< 5 ohms), you may not
have fully removed the insulation from one or both leads. Since the
insulation can be heat-stripped, you can usually improve the
electrical connection by re-heating each lead for 4 to 5 seconds.
 Similarly, check T1’s two windings (1-2 and 3-4) for
continuity. Then check T2's windings.

washer and 4-40 nut on the bottom. Do not over-tighten the
hardware; the standoff threads can be easily stripped.
 Install 7/16" (11 mm) hex male-female standoffs at the two
locations identified as (B) in Figure 6-9, replacing the existing
3/16" pan-head screws. Do not use any lock washers.
 Temporarily place the Filter board assembly on top of the
three standoffs just installed.  If the standoffs are in the correct
positions, they will be visible through their holes in the Filter board.

  When working with the side panels in the following steps,
place a soft cloth on your work surface to protect the paint. (A
clean anti-static mat will also suffice.)
 Locate the two side panels and arrange them as shown in
Figure 6-10, with the inside surfaces facing up. The right side can be
identified by the presence of an extra hole as shown. The

  Flat-head screws are more easily damaged than pan-
heads. Do not use excessive force when tightening them.
 Attach two 2-D fasteners to each side panel at the locations
indicated in Figure 6-10. (Make sure that the holes are countersunk;
if not, you may be working with the wrong side of the panel.)
Use one 3/16" (4.8 mm) flat-head screw to hold each 2-D fastener
to the side panel (Figure 6-11). The two unused holes on each
fastener must be offset away from the side panel as shown.

With the assembly upside-down or resting on one side, plug the
front panel assembly into the RF board (Figure 6-13). Connector J1
on the bottom of the front panel PC board mates with P1 on the
bottom of the RF board (indicated by an arrow below).
Figure 6-13
Secure the front panel to the side panels and RF board using two
flat-head and two pan-head 3/16" (4.8 mm) screws. Flat-head
screws are used on the top, and pan-head on the bottom. You may
need to adjust the 2-D fasteners slightly, then re-tighten all
hardware.
i
  The switches should now be accessible, and the headphone
jack should be even with the front panel. Also, the LEDs above the
VFO knob should be visible. If any of these controls are not
properly situated, you may not have the Front Panel fully plugged
into the RF board.
Note: The coaxial jumper to be installed in the following steps is
referred to as W1 in the RF board parts list.
 Cut a 2.6" (67 mm) length of RG-174 coax cable. Using a
sharp tool, remove about 3/8" (9 mm) of the coax jacket from
each end. Be careful not to nick the braid.
Figure 6-14
 Separate the braid (shield) from the center conductor at both
ends (Figure 6-14). Clip off about half the strands of the braid close
to the jacket, then twist the remaining braid into a fine bundle.
 Remove a small amount of insulation from the center
conductor. Use long-nose pliers to hold the center conductor while
stripping it, or you may pull it out of the coax jacket.
 On the bottom of the RF board you'll find the component
outlines for two 2-pin connectors, J9 and J10. Install the coax cable
on the bottom of the board between these two points. The center
conductor should be inserted into pin 1 of each connector (square
pad), and the braid into pin 2 (round pad). Do not solder yet.
 Make sure that the coax braid is not touching any adjacent
pads at either end, and that the coax is not covering the nearby
screw mounting hole. Solder the coax (on the bottom side of the
board). Trim the leads on the top side if there is excess lead length.

7. Alignment and Test, Part I
In this section you’ll become familiar with K1 operation, while
testing control circuits and aligning the VFO and receiver.
The Tap/Hold Rule
Each of the push-button switches on the front panel has two
functions, one activated by a TAP (short press) and the other
activated by a HOLD (long press, about 1/2 second). The upper
label on each switch shows the TAP function (white lettering), and
the lower label shows the HOLD function (yellow lettering). To
highlight this in the text, we use two different typographical styles
to identify switches: T A P   and  H O L D .
Initial Tests
i
  If any test or alignment step fails, refer to the
Troubleshooting section (Appendix E).
 To improve the visibility of the LCD during testing, you
should prop up the front edge with a non-conductive object (small
box, book, etc.). Note: Do not attach the KTS1 tilt stand at this
time. With the bottom cover removed, it could cause a short.
 Set AF GAIN fully counter-clockwise (minimum volume).
 Make sure the K1 is turned OFF (power switch S1 out).
 Plug your power supply or battery into J4 on the rear panel.
LED Test
i
  When you turn the K1 on the next step, watch for the
LED test. You should see the ATTN (yellow) LED turn on briefly,
followed by the RIT/XIT dual-color LED (green, then orange).
 Turn on power to the K1. If you see or smell smoke, or a
component feels hot to the touch, disconnect the power
source immediately. Locate the source of trouble before
proceeding.
 If you did not see the LED test, refer to Troubleshooting.
LCD and Error Codes
 You should now see E 2 7 on the LCD. This is an error code
which occurs when the K1 self-test finds that the Filter board is not
plugged in. (Error codes are listed and described in the
Troubleshooting tables.)
i
  If the LCD is blank, it may indicate that one or more
switches are closed. Check for shorts on all switch lines.
 Tap any switch to clear the error code. You should then see
E 4 2 , which indicates that the self-test found the VFO signal
missing. This is correct, since the VFO inductor, RF-L1, has not yet
been installed. (When the VFO is functioning normally, you'll see
the operating frequency displayed.)

Sidetone Generator and Audio Amplifier
 Plug in a pair of stereo headphones, and rotate the AF GAIN
control clockwise to about 9 or 10 o’clock.
 Tap M E N U . The first menu entry will be displayed: O U T 
(transmit power output).  Tap W P M + to select the next menu
entry, S T L (sidetone volume). (Lower-case "t" is used.)
 The Sidetone can be activated by editing the S T L menu
parameter. Hold E D I T to show the parameter and turn on the
sidetone. You can then use W P M + and W P M -  to vary the sidetone
level, from 0 -3 1 . Select a comfortable level, then tap M E N U to
turn off the sidetone and return to the S T L display.
Note:  S T L is used to set the sidetone volume level in relation to
normal received audio. However, the AF GAIN control sets the
overall headphone or speaker volume.
 Select the sidetone pitch menu entry (STP) using by tapping
W P M + . Hold E D I T to turn on the sidetone and edit the pitch
parameter. The pitch can be varied from 4 0 0 to 8 0 0 Hz using
W P M + and W P M - . Select the desired pitch, then tap M E N U  to end
parameter edit and return to S T P .
 Tap M E N U again to return to the normal display (in this case
E 4 2 because of the missing VFO signal).
Voltmeter
 On power-up, the LCD shows the operating frequency, with
100-Hz resolution. Holding D I S P L A Y  once selects S-meter mode.
Holding D I S P L A Y  again selects voltmeter mode. You should see
B A T flash briefly on the LCD, then your approximate power
supply or battery voltage, which will continue to flash slowly.
 Return to the operating frequency display by holding
D I S P L A Y  again. You should see E 4 2 , as explained previously.
Keyer
Note: If you don’t have a keyer paddle, you can still test the DOT
and DASH lines by using test clips to touch them to ground.
Plug a keyer paddle into the key jack (J3). The plug must be
stereo (2 circuit).  A stereo plug is supplied with the kit.
 Tap M E N U and locate the I N P menu entry (CW input device
selection). Hold E D I T to see the parameter, which defaults to H n d 
(hand key or external keyer). Use W P M + and W P M -  to select either
P D n or  P D r  (paddle normal, or paddle reverse). Then tap M E N U 
twice to return to the VFO display.
 Select the keyer speed using W P M + and W P M - . If you tap
these switches quickly, the speed will jump 2 WPM at a time.
 While listening with headphones, test the keyer paddle to
verify that both dot and dash are working.
 If you use a dual-lever keyer paddle, you may wish to use the
menu’s I A B entry to select iambic mode A or B (page 55).
Relays (Filter Board and Attenuator)
 Turn off the K1.
 Plug in the Filter board assembly. The connectors on the Filter
board must be fully inserted into J6, 7 and 8 on the RF board.
 Turn the K1 on. The LCD should show E 4 2 . You may also
hear one or more relays switching.
 Tap B A N D twice (quickly) to change to the next band. Tap
B A N D two or more times quickly to return to 7 . 0 MHz.
 Test the attenuator relay and the yellow LED by holding
A T T N . Hold A T T N again to turn the attenuator off.

VFO Alignment
 Turn the K1 off and disconnect the power supply.
Two different capacitors are supplied for setting the
approximate VFO range: C2 (68 pF disc) and C2A (120 pF
polystyrene). 68 pF provides a range of about 80 kHz; 120-pF
provides a range of about 150 kHz. Other values can also be used
(builder-supplied).
 Based on your VFO range selection (page 12), install the
appropriate capacitor at C2. Save the other for possible future use.
If you use the 68-pF disc cap, pre-form the leads to match the pad
spacing for C2.
 Wind L1 on a T50-6 toroid core (yellow, 1/2" [12 mm]
diameter). Use 24 inches (61 cm) of red enamel wire. Wind 33
turns on L1, leaving the two leads about 1/2" (12 mm) long.
 Adjust the turns of L1 so that they are fairly evenly spaced
and occupy about 90% of the core.
 Strip and tin the leads of L1 to within 1/8" (3 mm) of the
core. (Review toroid lead preparation instructions, page 14.)
 Secure L1 loosely to the PC board as indicated by its
component outline, near J6. As shown in Figure 7-1, use two nylon
washers, a 1/2" (12 mm) nylon screw, and nylon 4-40 nut.
Figure 7-1
 Insert L1’s leads into their pads and solder.
 Connect the power supply and turn the K1 on.
VFO Range Test
Tap M E N U and locate C A L . To enable the operating
frequency calibration display (O P F ), hold E D I T . The 100-Hz digit
should be flashing. (If you see E 4 2 , the VFO is not functioning.)
 To see the VFO frequency, you’ll use CAL’s other display
mode, O S C . To select this, hold D I S P L A Y . You’ll see O S C ,
followed by the VFO frequency in MHz (1 digit), then kHz (3
digits). For example, 3.012 MHz would be shown as 3 , then 0 1 2 .
 Make sure that the VFO frequency goes up as the VFO knob is
rotated counter-clockwise. If not, see Troubleshooting.
 Rotate the VFO knob fully clockwise until it stops, then note
the frequency: __________ kHz. Rotate it counter-clockwise until
it stops and note the frequency: __________ kHz.  Subtract the
low reading from the high reading to obtain the VFO range:
_________  (about 80 or 150 kHz, depending on the value of C2).
VFO Range Adjustment
 Make sure the VFO knob is rotated fully counter-clockwise.
 If the frequency shown is now higher than 3.100 MHz,
squeeze the turns of L1 (bunch them more closely together) to
lower the frequency. You can squeeze the turns by hand, or use the
tuning tool. Watch the frequency display as you adjust the turns.
 If the frequency shown is lower than 3.090 MHz, spread
the turns of L1 out. This raises the VFO frequency. If the frequency
cannot be raised to at least 3.090 by spreading the turns out, you
may need to remove one turn from L1 (the non-grounded end).
Note: The final VFO frequency should be between 3.090 MHz and
3.100 MHz to make sure that the low end of each band is covered.
 Once the turns on L1 have been correctly adjusted, tighten the
nylon screw so that the L1’s turns are held firmly in place. (This
may shift the indicated frequency slightly.)

Band Assignments
To see the correct display when you tap B A N D , you’ll need to
specify which bands are covered by your Filter board.
 If you re still in the C A L menu entry, tap M E N U to exit.
 Locate the B 1 menu entry (note that the "b " actually appears
in lower-case). If B 2 , B 3 , or B 4 is shown, tap B A N D to change it
to B 1 .
 To check the present assignment for band 1, the lowest-
frequency band, hold E D I T . The default is 7 . 0 MHz. Use W P M + or
W P M -  to specify band 1.
i
  On 30 meters, you have a choice of two band edges (1 0 . 0 
or 1 0 . 1 ), depending on your VFO range selection (from page 12).
The appropriate band edge is set by holding D I S P L A Y .
 Tap M E N U to return to the B 1 display, then tap B A N D to
switch to B 2 . Hold E D I T again to show the band 2 assignment.
 Use W P M + and W P M -  to specify band 2. If band 2 is 30
meters, select the band edge using D I S P L A Y .
 In the same manner, specify band 3 and band 4, if applicable
(four-band module only; see KFL1-4 manual, page 16).
 Tap M E N U twice to exit the menu.
 To re-check the band assignments, tap B A N D . The current
band will be displayed (in MHz), followed by a 3-digit display (1
kHz resolution), followed by the normal frequency display (to 100
Hz). For example, if the band is 40 meters and the VFO is set to
7025.3 kHz, tapping B A N D will show 7 , then 0 2 5 , and finally
2 5 . 3 . Tapping B A N D twice (quickly) switches to the other band.
Receiver Alignment
This section applies only to the two-band Filter board.
If you have a four-band Filter board installed, refer to the
KFL1-4 manual, page 17.
 Set the BFO trimmer, C20, so that its adjustment slot is
parallel to the nearby crystal. (C20 is located near the front edge of
the RF board.) The final setting of C20 will be determined later.
 If the present band is not band 1 (the lower frequency band),
tap B A N D twice quickly to select it.
 Make sure that the attenuator (yellow LED) is off.
 Plug in a pair of headphones or an external speaker, and adjust
the AF GAIN control until you hear some background noise. If you
do not hear any background noise, refer to Troubleshooting.
 Set the VFO to about the mid-point of the present band (7.050
MHz on 40 meters, 10.125 MHz on 30 meters, etc.). Tap B A N D if
necessary to verify that you’re in the right 100-kHz band segment.
 Connect an appropriate antenna for band 1. At minimum,
connect approximately 20-30 feet (6 to 9 meters) of any type of
wire to the center conductor of J5. In general, the longer and higher
the antenna, the more signal strength that will be available during
receiver alignment.
i
  Receiver alignment will be easiest if you use a ham-band
transmitter or signal generator to create a very strong signal that
can be located with the K1. If you use a transmitter, be sure to
connect it to a dummy load and operate it at low power.

Band-Pass Filter Alignment
On the Filter board, there are premix filters and RF filters for each
band, as shown in Figure 7-2. Each filter has two slug-tuned
inductors. These filters will be peaked in the following steps.
Premix
    RF
 Band 1
 Band 2
Figure 7-2
 Locate the plastic tuning tool. The smaller end of the tool will
be used to adjust the slug-tuned inductors.
 While listening to atmospheric noise or a CW signal, peak the
two band-1 Premix inductors, L1 and L2. Do not continue to turn
the slug if it has bottomed-out. Stop when you feel resistance. If
you cannot find a peak for L1 and L2, set them to about the mid-
point of their range for now and go on to the next step.
 Peak the two band-1 RF inductors, L5 and L6. If no signals are
heard while peaking either L1/L2 or L5/L6, use a transmitter to
generate a stronger signal, or scramble  the settings and try again.
 Re-peak L1 and L2, then L5 and L6, until no further
improvement is noted. Once all four inductors have been peaked,
received signals and noise should be quite strong.
 Tap B A N D twice (quickly) to select band 2.
 Switch to an appropriate antenna for this band, if available,
and set the VFO for the mid-point of the band.
 While listening to noise or a weak signal, peak the band-2
Premix inductors, L3 and L4.
 Peak the two band-2 RF inductors, L7 and L8.
 Re-peak L3 and L4, then L7 and L8, until no further
improvement is noted.
Coarse BFO Alignment
 The K1 three crystal filter bandwidths are selected by holding
the X F I L switch. Hold X F I L until you see F L 3 on the LCD.
Note: FL1, 2, and 3 are pre-set to bandwidths of about 800, 400,
and 250 Hz. They can be set up differently using F L x (page 53).
 Tune in a moderately-strong signal. Adjust the VFO slowly to
find the pitch where the signal is strongest. At this point, the signal
will be centered in the crystal filter.
 Locate the BFO trimmer, C20, near the front edge of the RF
board. Adjust C20 for approximately the desired signal pitch.
Fine BFO Alignment Using the Sidetone Pitch
 Select your desired sidetone pitch using the S T P menu entry.
(Many CW operators use 500-600 Hz or lower.) Exit the menu.
 Tune in a strong signal, adjusting the VFO slowly until the
signal strength is centered in the filter, as you did above.
 Turn on the sidetone again using the S T P menu entry.
 Adjust C20 so that the pitch of the received signal matches
your sidetone pitch. This is best done with both the received signal
and sidetone at about the same amplitude. The received signal will
seem to "disappear under" or "merge with" the sidetone when the
pitch is closely matched.
 Tap M E N U twice to return to normal operation.

Operating Frequency Calibration
The operating frequency display may be off by up to 10 kHz until
calibrated, due mostly to variations in the crystals on the Filter
board. Accuracy of +/- 100 Hz can be obtained.
Note: The approximate lower band edges in MHz are as follows:
3.50, 7.00, 10.00 or 10.10 (selected earlier), 14.00, 18.05, 21.00.
 Select the lower-frequency band using B A N D . Also select the
narrowest filter (F L 3 ) by holding X F I L .
 Tune in a signal at a known frequency, centering the signal in
the crystal filter passband. Use a signal from a known-accurate
signal generator, or check the signal’s frequency using a second
receiver.
 To access the operating frequency calibration display, locate
C A L in the menu, then hold E D I T . You’ll see O P F briefly, then
the operating frequency will be shown, with the 100-Hz digit
flashing. (If you see E 4 2 , the VFO is not functioning.)
 Tap W P M + or W P M -  until the displayed frequency matches
the frequency of the known signal. In the case of the internally-
generated signal, tap W P M + or W P M -  until the display reads 9 9 . 7 .
 Tap M E N U twice to return to the normal display.
 Tap B A N D twice quickly to switch to band 2.
 Repeat the calibration procedure on this band. If you have a 4-
band Filter board installed, repeat the procedure for bands 3 and 4.
i
  You can calibrate the dial on transmit rather than receive if
desired, after completing Alignment and Test, Part II. In this case
you ll need either a frequency counter or a calibrated ham-band
receiver to verify the actual transmit frequency. You ll then use the
C A L menu entry, as described above, to check and adjust the
operating frequency after each transmission.
AGC (Automatic Gain Control) and S-Meter Test
 Turn the K1 on and connect an antenna or signal generator.
 S-meter display mode provides a bar graph to indicate
approximate received signal strength. To select this mode, hold
D I S P L A Y . You should see a brief bar-graph test pattern, then the
display may go blank or show one or more bars.
 Tune in a strong signal. (Anytime you are actually moving the
VFO, the S-meter bargraph will be replaced with the frequency
display.) Once the signal is tune in, the AGC should be activated, as
indicated by an increase S-meter reading.2 The S-meter zero point
and scale can be adjusted (page 53). AGC can also be turned off if
necessary (page 57).
Note: Since the K1 uses audio-derived AGC, the initial code
element from a very strong station may be heard at louder volume.
This is due to the time it takes for the AGC detector capacitor to
charge up. If this is objectionable, the attenuator can be used.
Turning on the attenuator adds one bar to the S-meter reading to
roughly compensate for the loss in signal strength.
Receive Current Drain Test (Optional)
Typical current drain for the K1 in receive mode is approximately
55 mA (with all LEDs off). If the current drain is significantly
lower or higher than this, it could indicate a problem.
To check the current drain, set your DMM for DC milliamps and
temporarily insert the DMM in series between the K1 and the
power supply.  Turn the K1 on and note the current: _____ mA.
This completes receiver alignment.
                                                
2 Each bar corresponds to roughly two S-units, so that 4 or 5 bars indicates
about an "S-9" signal.

 Secure Q6 to the board using a 4-40 x 3/8" (9.5 mm) pan-head 
screw (shiny finish, not black), #4 internal-tooth lock washer, and 4-40 
nut. The screw should be inserted from the bottom side (Figure 8-1). 
 Verify the part number on Q6 (2SC2166, C2166 or 2SC2166, 
C2166), then solder. Trim the pins on the bottom. 
 Remove the right side panel if it is still attached. 
 Identify the hole in the right side panel where the thermal 
insulator will be placed (Figure 8-2). If the edge of the hole is not 
completely smooth, use a large drill bit to de-burr the hole by hand. 
Follow with a small amount of light sanding of the indicated area.  
 Attach a self-adhesive thermal pad to the side panel at the 
location shown in Figure 8-2. The hole in the thermal pad must be 
aligned precisely with the hole in the panel. The pad must be straight, 
not tilted or skewed in either direction.

 Bend the center lead of Q7 slightly away from the side panel,
forming it as shown in Figure 8-3.
 Hold the right side panel up to the right edge of the RF board.
Insert Q7's leads into their pads while guiding the panel into
position. Secure the right side panel to the RF board using two
3/16" (4.8 mm) flat-head screws.
 Solder and trim the leads of Q7 on the bottom of the board.
 Using an ohmmeter on a low resistance scale, check for a
short from Q7's tab to ground. (The tab is connected to the
collector lead.) The metal hardware used to hold Q7 to the side
panel may show low resistance to ground, but the tab should be
floating (> 1 k).
 Install 8-pin ICs U8 (SA602 or SA612AN) and U9 (LT1252). 
       Orient the ICs as indicated by their component outlines.

 Toroidal transformers T3 and T4 must be wound exactly as
described in the following steps. Recall that transformer windings
are identified by numbered pairs of leads, which correspond to the
numbered PC board pads.
 T3 is wound on an FT37-43 core (dark gray), the smaller of
the two cores remaining. Start with the 1-2 winding, which uses 12
turns of red enamel wire (9", 22 cm). See Figure 8-4.

the 1-2 winding as shown in Figure 8-4.
 Strip and tin T3’s leads.
 Install T3 flat against the PC board, to the right of Q6. Pull

 Cut two 8" (20 cm) lengths of enamel wire, one red and one 
green. Twist the wires together over their entire length. The wires 
should cross over each other approximately every 1/2" (1 cm). 
 Wind the twisted wires onto the 1/2" (12.7 mm) dia. ferrite core 
(FT50-43, dark gray), using 5 turns and covering about 85% of the 
core. Figure 8-5 shows how the winding should look.  
 Separate T4’s leads as shown in Figure 8-5. Strip and tin the 
leads. Be careful not to let the red and green wires short together. 
 Install T4 flat against the PC board as indicated by its outline.  
 Using your DMM on a low resistance scale, measure continuity 
between the #1 and #2 pads of T3. If you get a reading over 5 ohms, 
re-strip the affected lead(s). Similarly, check the 3-4 winding of T3. 
Then check T4's 1-3 and 2-4 windings. 
 
 If you plan to operate the K1 on 80 meters, and your K1 RF 
board is revision D or earlier, you may need to make a minor 
modification to the PC board. Please refer to the errata sheet included 
with the K1B80 (80-m Band Kit). 
Uninstalled Components 
 Make sure that all component locations on the RF board have 
been filled, except for two:  J1, which is supplied with the noise 
blanker option kit (KNB1), and C78, which may be supplied with the 
80-m band kit for the 2-band Filter board. If you have the 80 meter 
board, install C78 at this time on the bottom of the board near the PA 
and 12V labels with the (+) lead oriented as shown on t he outline. 
Fold C78 down flat against the board before soldering.  
Visual Inspection 
 Examine the bottom (solder side) of the RF board carefully for 
unsoldered pins, solder bridges, or cold solder joints.

9. Alignment and Test, Part II
In this section you’ll align and test the transmitter stages.
 Attach the side panels, then plug in the Front Panel assembly.
 Make sure the Filter board is not installed.
 Place the power switch, S1, in the OFF position (out).
 Connect a 12 to 14-V, 1-amp power supply (or battery) to J4.
 Turn on the K1. You should see E 2 7 on the LCD due to the
missing Filter board. Tap any switch to clear the message.
 Place the transmitter in TUNE mode (key-down), by holding
the W P M + and W P M -  switches simultaneously. The display should
show 0 . 1 watts, even though actual power output is zero.

 Turn off the K1. Plug in the Filter board.
 Connect an antenna that is adequate for receiver testing.
Plug in a pair of stereo headphones or a speaker at J2.
 Turn on the K1 and test receive performance. If receiver gain
seems to be too low, you may have an assembly error in the
transmit stages or T-R switch. Remove the Filter board and re-
check the orientation of all diodes, transistors, and ICs. Also look
for shorts on both the top and bottom of the board in the
transmitter area. (Also see Troubleshooting.)
 Switch to the voltmeter display to make sure that the battery
or power supply voltage is not being pulled down when the K1 is
turned on. (Hold D I S P L A Y  once to select S-meter mode, and a
second time to select voltmeter mode.)
Preparation for Transmit Alignment
 Turn the K1 off. Secure the Filter board to its three standoffs
using 3/16" (4.8 mm) pan-head screws and #4 split lock washers.
 Connect a 50-ohm dummy load at the antenna jack. The
dummy load should be rated at 5 watts or higher.
 Connect a key or keyer paddle.
 Turn the K1 on.
 Tap M E N U and locate the O U T entry (power output level).
Hold E D I T , then use W P M + and W P M -  to set power to 2 . 0 watts.

Band 1 Alignment
If a 4-band Filter board is in use, refer to the KFL1-4 manual, page 19.
All filters are shared between receiver and transmitter, so transmit
alignment should already be close. However, it's important to re-
peak the filters on transmit. An analog wattmeter, ham-band
receiver, or the K1’s built-in digital wattmeter can be used.
 Switch to lower-frequency band using B A N D . Set the VFO to
approximately the middle of the desired band.
 Refer Figure 7-2 to identify the band 1 inductors.
i
  The K1 can be placed in TUNE mode by holding the
W P M + and W P M -  switches together. During TUNE, the power in
watts will be shown on the LCD (e.g., P 2 . 0 ). Hitting the key or
pressing any switch except W P M + and W P M -  will cancel TUNE.
 Put the K1 into TUNE mode. Using the alignment tool, adjust
L1, L2, L5 and L6 for maximum output. If the output jumps up to
well above 2 watts, exit TUNE mode, then re-enter it again.3
 If necessary, repeat the adjustment of the filters two or three
times to be sure that you have the inductors peaked correctly. If
output is < 2 w or is not stable, see Troubleshooting.
 If possible, verify that the K1 is transmitting on the correct
frequency using an external ham-band receiver. Connect a short
length of wire to the receiver's antenna jack. (Do not connect the
K1 directly to the receiver.) Key the K1 and locate the signal.
 To make sure that the filters are peaked at the correct
frequency, vary each inductor a small amount while observing the
receiver's S-meter.
                                                
3 The transmitter's ALC (automatic level control) attempts to set the power
you specify. ALC is activated for 1-2 seconds when you enter TUNE mode.
After that, it is "open-loop," allowing you to adjust the filters. If the power
jumps, re-starting TUNE mode will activate the ALC again, reducing the
drive back down to the level needed to stay at about 2 watts.
Band 2 Alignment
 Switch to band 2, and set the VFO to about mid-band.
 Put the K1 into TUNE mode and adjust L3, L4, L7, and L8
for maximum output (refer to Figure 7-2 if necessary).
 Verify that the K1 is transmitting at the intended frequency.
5-watt Test
 Set power output to 5 . 0 watts using the O U T menu entry.
 Enter TUNE mode briefly. The wattmeter should display
approximately 5 watts. Test 5-watt output on both bands.
Transmit Offset Adjustment
 Locate the offset test switch (S2) on the bottom of the RF
board. Place it in the TEST position. You should hear a tone in the
headphones; its pitch is equal to the transmit offset. If you don’t
hear a tone, try rotating C13 (back left corner, near the key jack).
 Using the menu, locate S T P (sidetone pitch), and go into edit
mode to turn on the sidetone. You should now hear two tones: the
sidetone and the transmit offset tone. If the sidetone is very weak
or very strong compared to the transmit offset tone, use the S T L 
menu entry to adjust the sidetone volume. Note: The receiver is
muted in S T L edit mode, so you'll have to return to S T P after
making any change to the sidetone setting.
 Adjust C13 so that the transmit offset pitch is as close as
possible to your selected sidetone pitch. The two will seem to
"merge" when the pitches are matched.
 Exit the menu, and set S2 back to the OPER position.
 If  necessary, use the C A L menu entry to calibrate the
operating frequency on transmit (see page 41).
This completes transmitter alignment.

1. Final Assembly
 Remove any masking tape from the top and bottom covers. Use 
the technique described on page 23. 
 Remove and save the hardware supplied with the antenna and key 
jacks. 
 The components on the bottom of the board must have an overall 
height of no more than about 0.2” (5 mm) above the PC board. Fold 
down or re-solder components if necessary. 
 Install the bottom cover by sliding it over the rear-panel controls. 
Secure it to the rest of the assembly using six 3/16" (4.8 mm) pan-head 
screws. 
 Install the hardware supplied with the antenna and key jacks. Be 
careful not to strip the plastic threads on the antenna jack.

 Trim the speaker grille cloth so it is the same size as the speaker 
frame and then trim the corners so it fits between the fiber washers. 
Keep the grille cloth in place as you secure the speaker to the top 
cover using four 5/16" (8 mm) flat-head screws, #4 fiber washers 
(black), #4 metal  flat washers, #4 internal-tooth lock washers, and 4-
40 nuts (Figure 10-2). The fiber washers go between the speaker and 
the top cover. Do not over-tighten the nuts, as this can flex the 
speaker frame, causing damage to the speaker and/or distorted 
audio.

 Insert the copper wire into the pin 1 position of a two-pin
housing as shown. Insert the other wire into the pin 2 position.
 Connect the other end of this cable to the speaker terminals.
The copper wire should be connected to the lug marked (+) on the
speaker. Solder both wires.
 If there are any missing chassis screws in the bottom cover,
side panels, or front panel, install them now.
 Plug the internal speaker cable into P2 on the RF board. The
connector is keyed and can only be plugged in one way.
i
  When you install the top cover in the next step,
route the speaker cable along the right side of the cabinet,
away from the pins of the microcontroller (front panel, U1).
The speaker wire could pick up signals from the microcontroller,
causing receiver interference.
 Place the top cover onto the chassis. Secure the top cover
using two pan-head and two flat-head 3/16 (4.8 mm) screws.
 Four self-adhesive feet are supplied for the bottom cover.
Install one at each corner, approximately 1/4" (6 mm) from edges.
 Attach the self-adhesive serial number label to the rear panel
of the bottom cover in the space provided.
 Write the serial number on the inside cover of your manual.
 If you have the KTS1 wide-range tilt-stand, you should
configure it for desk-top use (using the short arms) and attach it to
the K1 at this time. Refer to the KTS1 instructions.
This completes assembly of your K1 Transceiver. You should have a
number of washers, screws, and other hardware left over. These
items have been provided as spares. Please read the Operation
section, which follows, and try each of the K1's features. If you're
new to QRP, be sure to read the QRP Operating Tips (page 56).
i
  If you have purchased K1 internal options, we recommend
that you do not install them until becoming familiar with basic K1
operation. Once you're ready to build option kits, the suggested
order of assembly is: KFL1-2 or KFL1-4, KAT1, KNB1, KBT1.

11. Operation
This section explains how to set up and operate the K1. We suggest
you read the first few pages as an overview, then follow the
tutorial, which starts on page 54 (Basic K1 Operation). There's also
a Quick Reference, Appendix G, which shows the locations of
front-panel controls and describes each of the menu entries.
Connections
Power Supply
You can use any 9-15 V DC power supply; current drain is about
0.5-1A on transmit. A mating DC power connector is provided
with the kit. Use an in-line 2A fuse when operating from a
battery or power supply that does not include its own fuse.
Low Battery warnings: If your battery (or power supply) voltage
drops below about 9 V, you’ll see a brief  B A T  L O message flashed
on the LCD once every 5 minutes (approx.). This voltage level was
chosen to be compatible with an 8-cell NiMH or NiCd battery back.
Other battery types may have a different end-of-life
voltage; check the voltage using BAT display mode often.
12-V gel-cell batteries must be recharged at 10.5-11.0 V.
Headphones or External Speaker
The front-panel headphone jack can accommodate either
headphones or an external speaker, with an impedance of 8 ohms
or higher. A stereo plug or mono/stereo adapter is required,
unless you modify the RF board (see 2nd step on page 31).
Keying Device
Any type of hand key, bug, or external keyer can be plugged into
the KEY jack, or you can connect a paddle and use the K1's built-in
memory keyer. In all cases, you must use a stereo plug with the
keying device (a suitable plug is provided with the kit). It is also
possible to connect both a keyer paddle and another keying device
at the same time; see Keying Device Selection (page 55).
Antenna
Any well-matched, unbalanced (usually coax-fed) antenna can be
used with the K1. With non-resonant antennas or balanced
feedlines a suitable balun and/or antenna tuner will be required. If
you have the KAT1 automatic antenna tuner option installed, you
can connect a wide range of random length or non-resonant
antennas directly to the K1 and use them on one or more bands.
Power setting accuracy with internal RF detector: Power
readings using the K1's built-in RF detector (D15) are only accurate
when the SWR is low. If you use a poorly-matched load, you should
check your power output with an external wattmeter. In some cases
a high-SWR load can result in excessive current drain.
Power setting accuracy with KAT1: If you have the KAT1
installed, power output display will be much more accurate under all
SWR conditions, since the tuner provides its own calibrated SWR
bridge/wattmeter.

Calibration Functions
The F L x , B x , C A L , and S I G menu entries are typically used
during initial test and setup of the K1. B x and C A L are also used
whenever you plug in a different Filter module to allow the K1 to
display the correct frequencies.
Crystal Filter Bandwidth Selection (FLx)
The K1 provides three crystal filter bandwidths, FL1, 2, and 3,
which are selected using X F I L during normal operation. By default,
the filters are set to about 800, 400, and 250 Hz. You can change
these settings using the F L x menu entry.
To modify the bandwidth for a particular filter, enter the menu and
scroll to F L x (where x is 1 , 2 , or 3 ). Use X F I L to change the menu
entry to the desired filter. Hold E D I T , then tap W P M + / W P M -  to
select one of the available bandwidths, in Hz. The bandwidth
settings are approximate.
The BFO is not programmable. One setting of C20 on the RF board
is used for all filters (see page 40).
Band Assignment (Bx)
This menu entry is used to tell the K1 firmware what bands your
Filter board covers, allowing the B A N D switch and VFO to display
the correct frequencies. You should set up B 1 and B 2 (as well as B 3 
and B 4 if applicable), then do VFO calibration using C A L .
The B x parameter can be set to any band from 1 . 8 to 2 8 . 0 MHz,
corresponding to the components on the Filter board. Some of
these bands may not available from Elecraft, but can still be used if
you obtain the necessary components.
On 30 meters, you have a choice of two different band edges,
corresponding to your selected VFO range (see page 12). Hold
D I S P L A Y  to select either 1 0 . 0 or 1 0 . 1 MHz.
Operating Frequency Calibration and VFO Test (CAL)
This menu entry is used to calibrate the operating frequency
display, or to align the VFO. (VFO test and alignment is covered in
detail on page 38.)
To calibrate the operating frequency: Switch to the band to be
calibrated and tune in a signal at a known frequency. Then select
C A L in the menu and hold E D I T . You'll see O P F briefly, then the
operating frequency will be displayed to 100 Hz. The last digit
flashes as a reminder that you're in calibration mode. Use W P M + 
and W P M -  to set the reading to match the known frequency.
Note: Each band must be set independently since they use different
crystals on the Filter board.
To check the range of the VFO: After holding E D I T , hold D I S P L A Y 
to switch to O S C . The display will then show you the MHz and
kHz portion of the VFO frequency, alternating about once per
second. Turn the VFO pot all the way in both directions to check
the range. Holding D I S P L A Y  again will switch back to O P F 
(operating frequency calibration display).
S-Meter Calibration (SIG)
To check the S-meter zero setting, use D I S P L A Y  to switch to S-
meter mode, make sure the attenuator is OFF, and disconnect the
antenna. With no signal, the S-meter should indicate 0 bars, or the
first bar may just be flickering on. If not, you can use the S I G 
menu entry to change the L x x parameter. After each change to
L x x , hold E D I T to exit the menu and return to the S-meter display
to see the effect on the S-meter reading.
To check the S-meter full-scale setting, re-connect the antenna and
tune in a very strong signal. If the S-meter's reading appears to be
too low or too high for the given signal strength, use the S I G menu
entry to change the H x parameter. (To get to the H x parameter,
hold D I S P L A Y  while the L x x parameter is displayed.) Reducing the
Hx parameter value will increase the S-meter reading.

Basic K1 Operation
Self-Test: A number of tests are done at power-up. If you see an
error message (such as E 4 2 ), refer to Troubleshooting.
Band and Frequency Display: When you turn on the K1 or tap
B A N D , the current band and operating frequency will be displayed.
For example, if the last band used was 40 meters and the VFO was
set to 7025.3 kHz, the LCD would show 7 , then 0 2 5 , and finally
2 5 . 3 .
Changing Bands: To change bands, tap B A N D quickly two or
more times.
Receiver Setup
Display Mode: Holding D I S P L A Y  alternates between three
receive-mode displays: frequency (default), S-meter, and
voltmeter. For normal operation, use frequency or S-meter mode.
(In S-meter mode, the frequency is re-displayed automatically
whenever the VFO is moved.)
AF GAIN: Adjust the AF GAIN control for comfortable headphone
or speaker volume. The sidetone volume can be set higher or lower
in relation to receiver audio using the S T L menu entry.
Crystal Filter Selection: Filter FL1 (usually the widest filter) is
selected on power-up. Holding X F I L cycles through the filters. Use
narrower filters to reduce interference from nearby stations.
Attenuator: Holding A T T N switches in about 14 dB of attenuation.
This may be useful if extremely strong signals are causing receiver
overload. The receiver has sufficient sensitivity to allow the
attenuator to be left in at all times, if necessary. If you turn the
attenuator on when the display is in S-meter mode, an extra bar is
added to the S-meter display to compensate. (Note: You can disable
LEDs to save current using the L E D menu entry.)
Transmitter Setup
Display Mode: During transmit the LCD normally shows a
bargraph (1 bar per watt). If you select supply voltage display mode
(using D I S P L A Y ), the power supply or battery voltage will be
shown, flashing slowly. In TUNE mode, power is shown in watts
(see below). SWR can be displayed if the KAT1 ATU is installed.
Setting Power Output: Approximate power output can be set
using the O U T menu entry (0 . 1 to 7 . 0 watts). Anytime you
change the power level or change bands, you’ll see power start out
near zero, then go up while you send the first few characters of
CW. This is due to the transmitter’s ALC (automatic level
control). Caution: When working into non-50-ohm loads, the
power display may not be accurate.
TUNE Mode: To put the transmitter into TUNE mode (key-
down), press the W P M + and W P M -  switches simultaneously. At 5
watts, the display would show P 5 . 0 . (It is normal for this number
to vary over as much as several tenths of a watt.) While in TUNE
mode, you can change power output using W P M + and W P M - .
Keyer Test Mode: It is possible to completely disable the
transmitter to do keyer or message buffer testing (page 55).
QSK Delay and Sidetone: The QSK delay is set with the T - R 
menu entry. Sidetone volume and pitch are set using the S T L and
S T P menu entries, respectively.
Transmit Offset: The transmit offset should be matched to your
selected sidetone pitch using C13 on the RF board. This is normally
accomplished during alignment (page 47).
Transmit Frequency Limits: Some countries require transmit to
be disabled outside of specified amateur bands. Your K1 may include
such limits encoded in firmware. In this case, if you key the
transmitter with the VFO set outside the usable range, you’ll see
E n d on the LCD.

       55
RIT and XIT
RIT (receive incremental tuning) can be used to fine-tune the pitch
of a received signal without affecting your transmit frequency. This
is most often used when a station calls you off frequency. To turn
on RIT, tap R I T . The RIT LED (green) will turn on, and the LCD's
decimal point will flash slowly. You can then use the OFFSET
control to vary the receive frequency.
XIT works similarly to RIT, except that the transmit frequency is
varied with the offset control. For example, suppose a DX station
says to call "up". First, turn on R I T and use the OFFSET control to
find a clear spot above the DX station's frequency. Then turn on
XIT by holding X I T [ P F n ] .5 The XIT LED (orange) will turn on. If
you need to determine the transmit frequency when using XIT,
briefly turn on R I T , then switch back to X I T .
OFFSET Range: The range of the OFFSET control is determined
by the value of C7, in the VFO area of the RF board. A larger or
smaller value of C7 will increase or decrease the OFFSET range,
respectively.
 Keying Device Selection
A single connector in the back is provided for your keyer paddle,
hand key, keyer, or computer. You must use a stereo (2-circuit)
plug, even if you use only a hand key or external keyer. This should
not affect the use of the keying device with other equipment, since
the middle contact on the plug (often called the "ring" contact) is
only used with keyer paddles.
Hand key or External Keying Device: To use a hand key,
external keyer, computer, or external keying device, set I N P to
H n d  using the menu. You can key the K1 externally at up to 70
WPM. Note: The K1's message memories can only be programmed
using a directly-connected keyer paddle.
                                                
5 If you have assigned the XIT [PFn] switch to another function using the
PFn menu entry, you cannot use XIT.
Internal Keyer: To use a keyer paddle, use the menu to set I N P 
to P D n or P D r  (normal or reverse paddle). With P D n selected,
the "tip" contact on the stereo key jack is DOT and "ring" (the
middle contact) is DASH. P D r  is the reverse.
Keyer Setup
Keyer Speed: Use the W P M + and W P M -  switches to select the
desired CW speed. The display will show the speed in WPM.
Tapping either switch quickly two or more times will cause the
speed to jump in 2 WPM increments.
Iambic Mode Selection: If you use a keyer paddle with two
mechanically-independent levers, you can use iambic keying,
meaning that both the DOT and DASH paddles can be pressed at
the same time to generate a repeating DOT-DASH or DASH-DOT
pattern. With practice, this can improve sending efficiency. The
I A B menu entry allows you to select from two Iambic modes: A or
B . If you're not sure which to use, select mode A (the default)
which has more forgiving timing characteristics. Mode A is similar
to mode A of the Curtis keyer IC; mode B is similar to Super CMOS
Keyer III mode B.
Keyer Test Mode
At times you may want to disable the transmitter completely so
that you can practice recording messages or just sending code with
the keyer. The K1 has a built-in Keyer Test mode for this.
To activate keyer test mode, first select the O U T menu entry and
hold E D I T to display the power output level. Next, hold D I S P L A Y .
The power output parameter will change to P = 0 , indicating that
the transmitter is disabled. To restore the original power level
setting, hold D I S P L A Y  again.
Note: Turning power to the K1 off and back on cancels keyer test
mode and restores the original power level.

    ELECRAFT
Recording and Playing Messages
The K1 provides two CW message memories of 90 bytes each. CW
messages can only be recorded using a keyer paddle connected
directly to the K1's key jack. Set I N P to P D n or P D r . Messages are
stored in EEPROM, so they won't be lost when power is turned off.
To Record a Message: Hold R E C , and when prompted with 1 - 2 ,
tap either 1  or 2 . The display will then show REC 90, indicating
that 90 bytes of storage are available in this message buffer. This
number will count down toward 0 as long as you are sending.
Whenever you stop sending completely, up to two standard-length
word spaces will be inserted. To stop recording, tap M S G . If you do
this before starting to send, the original message contents will not
be lost.
To Play a Message: Tap M S G , then select a message by tapping
either 1  or 2 . Message play can be canceled at any time by hitting
M S G  again or by tapping the keyer paddle. You can also change the
keyer speed while messages are playing, using W P M + and W P M -  as
usual.
Keyer Test Mode: To play back messages without transmitting,
use keyer test mode (page 55). In this mode, you'll see P = 0 on the
LCD during message play, rather than the transmit bargraph.
Using Auto-Repeat
Either message memory can be auto-repeated when played, which is
useful when calling CQ on a quiet band or during contests.
Sometimes a band will be open but will "sound" dead, simply because
no one is calling CQ at that moment. This is a great time to let
auto-repeat do the work.
To use Auto-Repeat: Tap M S G  as usual, but then hold either 1  or
2 . The message will then play back continuously until you tap M S G 
again or hit your key or paddle. You'll see R P T on the display in-
between message transmissions.
Setting the Auto-Repeat Interval: The length of the pause
between messages during auto-repeat can be programmed using the
R P T menu entry (0 -2 5 5 sec.). Long delays are useful for beacons.
Using RIT During Message Repeat: You can use RIT (if it is
turned on) to listen above and below your receive frequency
between calls. This is useful when stations call you off-frequency.
QRP Operating Tips
Antennas: When you're using low power, a good antenna and
ground system can make a big difference. In general, antennas
should be mounted as high off the ground as possible, and resonant
or multi-element antennas will be the most effective. An excellent
choice for light-weight, multi-band portable use is a long, end-fed
wire, used in conjunction with two or more ground radials and an
antenna tuner. There are many references on antennas available,
including the ARRL Antenna Handbook.
QRP Frequencies: Low-power enthusiasts can be found at certain
"watering holes" on each band, listed below (MHz). An asterisk (*)
indicates European or alternative QRP frequencies.
80 m:   3.560
40 m:    7.040 (*7.030)
30 m: 10.106 (*10.116)
20 m:  14.060
17 m: 18.096
15 m:  21.060
Calling and Listening: Calling CQ with low power may be
frustrating unless you have a good antenna. Usually, you'll spend far
more time listening. Keep transmissions short, especially when
working other QRP stations, which will often be at or even below
the noise level. Narrower filters (< 500 Hz) and slower code speeds
should be used when conditions are marginal.
Contests: Both general interest and QRP-only contests provide a
great way to work new states or countries. The K1, with its low
current drain and compact size, is particularly well-suited to outdoor
events such as Field Day and QRP To The Field.

Advanced Operating Features
Programmable Function Switch (XIT [PFn])
By default, the X I T [ P F n ]  switch turns XIT on and off.
Alternatively, this switch can be set up as a direct edit shortcut to
any menu entry. To program the switch function, enter the menu
and scroll to P F n , then change the parameter to the desired menu
entry. Setting it to N O R (normal) assigns the switch to XIT.
Spotting
The S T P menu entry can be used to "spot," or match the pitch of
received signals, so that you'll be exactly on frequency when you
transmit. To spot a signal, select the S T P menu entry, hold E D I T ,
then adjust the VFO until the received signal pitch matches the
sidetone pitch. The received signal may seem to disappear when the
pitch is exactly matched. You can assign S T P to the
programmable function switch if you don’t use XIT (see above).
X I T [ P F n ]  will then activate the spot signal.
AGC Control
Some operators prefer to turn AGC off and use manual gain control
under certain weak-signal conditions. To turn AGC off, use the
A G C menu entry. The attenuator may help with strong signals.
Checking the Firmware Revision
Hold any switch on power-up to display the revision (e.g. 1 0 8 ).
Resetting to Factory Defaults (requires rev. 108 or higher)
Reset to defaults takes two steps. Step 1: Hold B A N D and M E N U 
together on power-up, releasing the switches after the LED test.
You should see E 0 9 .  Step 2: Turn power off and back on again;
you should see E 1 0 . You’ll then need to re-do VFO calibration, etc.
K1 Options
Four- and Two-Band Filter Modules (KFL1-4, -2)
The KFL1-4 and KFL1-2 options provide additional bands of your
choice, allowing you to select the best combination of bands for
home use, field trips or specific operating events. The KFL1-4
includes 40, 30, 20, and either 17 or 15 meters.
Wide-Range Tilt Stand (KTS1)
When hiking or camping, you may find that there's no table or
other smooth surface on which to operate a transceiver. The KTS1
solves this problem by allowing you to rest the K1 on nearly any
rough surface (rock, dirt, etc.) and tilt the display upwards to the
ideal viewing angle. It also keeps antenna and power connections
away from the ground, and provides a mounting point for a keyer
paddle. (Refer to our web site for information on custom paddles.)
Noise Blanker (KNB1)
The KNB1 is effective in reducing pulse-type noise, such as that
from power poles or automobile ignition systems.
Automatic Antenna Tuner (KAT1)
If the KAT1 internal automatic antenna tuner is installed, you can
connect coax-fed or random-length wire antennas directly to the
K1. An inexpensive home-made balun can be used with balanced
lines. In most cases the tuner will allow you to match one antenna
on all bands. Once you've tuned up an antenna, the tuner's L and C
settings will be recalled instantly when the band is changed.
Internal Battery (KBT1)
The KBT1 includes an 8-AA-cell socket and a replacement top
cover with a quick-access battery door. Any cell type may be used.

12. Circuit Details
While reading this section, refer to the Block Diagram (Appendix
B) and schematics (Appendix C).
Overview
The K1 is a compact, high-efficiency CW transceiver capable of
operating over a wide range of frequencies. The two (or four) bands
of operation are determined by a single plug-in filter module,
allowing the builder to swap in a different set of bands if desired.
The firmware will recognize whether a two- or four-band board is
installed.
The filter module includes the band-pass filters and crystals for the
K1's pre-mix conversion scheme, in which a low-frequency (~3
MHz) VFO is subtracted from a high-frequency crystal oscillator to
produce a "pre-mixed" injection frequency for the transmit and
receive mixers. Because of the VFO's low operating frequency,
stability is excellent. An analog VFO is used, resulting in a lower
noise floor than most synthesized transceivers. The filter board
also has RF band-pass and low-pass filters for each band.
The receiver is a single-conversion superhet, using down-
conversion to a low intermediate frequency (I.F.) of about 4.915
MHz. Down-conversion minimizes complexity and receive-chain
noise, while the low I.F. allows good CW selectivity with a 4-pole
crystal filter. The use of active mixers keeps current consumption
low, compatible with portable operation.
There are three stages of transmitter amplification. Maximum
power output from the final stage (class C) is about 5 to 7 watts,
depending on the band and supply voltage. The T-R circuitry is all
solid-state (no relays), resulting in smooth, fast QSK.
A low-power microcontroller (MCU) on the front-panel board is
used to control the transceiver and handle user interface elements,
such as the display and switches. A second, smaller microcontroller,
the I/O controller (IOC), acts as a driver for the filter and
attenuator relays. The  IOC is controlled by the main MCU via a
one-line network, the auxBus. Option microcontrollers (i.e., on the
noise blanker and antenna tuner) also communicate via the auxBus.
Front Panel Board
Microcontroller (MCU) U1 is used to control all K1 functions, and
doubles as the driver for the LCD, DS1. U1 runs at just below 4
MHz. The crystal, X1, is intentionally kept under 4 MHz (by using
large oscillator capacitors), so that any internally-generated band-
edge signals will be below the bottom edge of the band.
The LCD segments are driven with 50% duty cycle square waves to
ensure that the average DC voltage on each segment is 0 volts. The
LCD backplane (pin 24) is also driven by a low-frequency square
wave. To turn on a segment, it must be driven 180-degrees out of
phase with the backplane. In-phase segments remain off.
The MCU has a number of miscellaneous functions. It reads the
states of the switches (S1-S6) by periodically making the associated
LCD drive lines into inputs. The VFO signal is amplified by Q1,
then counted at MCU pin 6 (RA4). Pin 3 (RA1) is made an A-to-D
(analog-to-digital) input to read the battery voltage, or an output to
turn the ATTN LED on or off. Pin 4 (RA2) drives to 6 V or 0 V to
turn on the RIT or XIT LEDs, respectively (both part of D1), by

============================================================
PAGE 60
============================================================

ELECRAFT
       59
virtue of an intermediate voltage supplied by op-amp U5A. To turn
both elements of D1 off, pin 4 is made an input.
The states of the DOT and DASH lines are sampled on analog input
RA3 (pin 5). If both DOT and DASH are open, the voltage at RA3
will be about 6 V. If both are closed, the voltage will be 0 V. If only
one paddle is closed, an intermediate voltage results, either 2 V or 4
V. (See RF board, sheet 2.)
Q2 defeats the RIT/XIT offset when its gate voltage is at 6 V,
since its low drain-source resistance forces a fixed 3 V to appear at
the wiper of the offset pot, R3.
U2 and U3 are controlled by the SDA (data) and SCL (clock) lines,
using the industry-standard I2C protocol. U2 is a dual-output D-to-
A converter that controls the power level and generates audio
tones. When tones are not being generated, the tone output is used
to set the crystal filter bandwidth. U3 is a 512-byte EEPROM,
which stores all K1 operating parameters and CW messages.
VFO pot R1 is physically part of the front panel assembly, but its
wiper voltage (0-6 V) is routed to the RF board via J1. R19, located
between the wiper and the high end of the pot, improves tuning
linearity.
Filter Board
Note: This section applies to the 2-band filter module (KFL1-2).
For details on the four-band module, refer to the KFL1-4 manual.
L1-L4 and associated capacitors form two band-pass filters, one for
the premix signal on each band. There are also crystals for each
band (X1, X2). For example, on 40 m (7.000 MHz), the premixer
(U7, RF board) mixes a 3.085-MHz signal from the VFO with a
15.000 MHz crystal oscillator to obtain a difference signal at
11.915 MHz. There is also a sum frequency, 18.085 MHz, which is
rejected by the band-pass filter. The 11.915 MHz signal is routed to
the RF board at P1 pin 6.
L5-L8 and associated capacitors form two RF bandpass filters, one
for each band. T-R switching circuits on the RF board place these
filters in either the receive or transmit path. L9-L12 and associated
capacitors form the two low-pass filters.
All filters and the two crystals are switched by latching relays K1-
K3. Microcontroller U1 pulses the relay coils bidirectionally to
switch them on or off. The reset condition of each relay selects
band 1. Latching relays are only energized when switched between
set and reset, so they consume no power during normal operation.
RF Board
VFO (Sheet 1)
Q8 is used in a varactor-tuned Colpitts VFO. The VFO tunes
"backward." For example, its frequency is about 3.080 MHz when
the operating frequency is 7.000 MHz, and 2.930 MHz when the
operating frequency is 7.150 MHz. This is due to the fact that the
VFO is subtracted from the crystal oscillator in the premixer (U7).
The use of varactor diodes (electronic tuning) results in a
compromise between circuit complexity, tuning range, and stability.
While VFO drift can never be eliminated entirely, steps were taken
to minimize it.
First, the VFO supply voltage is double-regulated (explained in the
next paragraph). This improves stability by guaranteeing a very
stable voltage reference for the varactor diodes. Since the
transmitter circuits run from a different regulator, and since the
VFO is also well-buffered from the transmitter, there is virtually no
VFO frequency shift or chirp on key down over the full power
output range (0.1-7 watts). Second, temperature-compensation
techniques are used in the VFO itself, including careful selection of
capacitor types. The inductor used has a low temperature
coefficient, and its turns are adjusted to select the desired range,
which eliminates drift-prone trimmer capacitors.

============================================================
PAGE 61
============================================================

    ELECRAFT
Q9 isolates the VFO from noise pickup on the frequency counter
line. U5 and U6 double-regulate the VFO supply voltage for
improved stability. Since U5 is a low-dropout 8-volt regulator, the
K1's supply voltage can drop to as low as about 8.5 V without
affecting the VFO frequency. U6 is a 6.0-volt regulator with a very
tight tolerance of 2.5%.
Premixer U7 mixes the VFO with one of the crystals on the Filter
board.
Receiver (Sheet 1)
U1 is a double-balanced receive mixer, which provides an excellent
noise figure at low current drain. If input levels are too high, an
attenuator can be switched in via K1. RFC9 (across K1) suppresses
attenuator on/off switching noise that might otherwise be audible.
Emitter-follower Q3 provides some power gain while providing a
low driving impedance for the crystal filter (X1-X4). The crystal
filter has variable bandwidth, by virtue of varactor diodes D6-D8.
T2 steps up the crystal filter output to match the 1500-ohm input
impedance of the product detector/BFO, U2. The BFO is mixed
with the I.F. to produce an audio signal.
U3 amplifies the audio signal enough to drive the audio-derived
AGC detector, D2. R21 and C18 remove high-frequency hiss.
D2 is DC-biased just below the level needed to turn on darlington
transistor Q2. When a signal is present, Q2 will turn on in
proportion to the signal amplitude, pulling the AGC line down from
its nominal 1.2 V to as low as 0.6 V. The AGC line is connected to
the input bias pins of both U1 and U2, so that the gain of both
mixers is reduced as signal strength increases. R1 limits the gain
reduction at U1, so most of the AGC action is due to U2, which
minimizes the chance of front-end overload when AGC is activated.
Only signals in the passband of the crystal filter can cause AGC in
any case, so the AGC line stays at about 1.2 V most of the time.
Q10 and Q11 are shunt and series mute devices, respectively. Both
are required due to the large amount of audio gain in the receiver.
U4 amplifies the received audio signal and sidetone to headphone or
speaker level. The AF GAIN control is located on the front panel,
but is electrically connected between Q11 and U4 at the AF1 and
AF2 points.
In receive mode, the AGC signal is routed onto the RF/SMTR line,
which is then sampled by an A-to-D input on the MCU (U1, front
panel). Q1 is used to connect or disconnect the AGC signal from
the RF/SMTR line.
Transmitter (Sheet 2)
To vary the power output, JFET Q5 and PIN diode D18 control
the amount of premix signal input to the transmit mixer, U8. The
DC control voltage at the drain of Q5 is set by the MCU (U1, front
panel). ALC (automatic level control) is implemented in firmware.
During keying, the ALC determines what DC voltage is needed to
get to the requested power level, as well as what voltage
corresponds to zero output. As you key the transmitter, the control
voltage alternates between these two levels so that that the keying
waveform can be effectively shaped by R10 and C59.
Video amplifier U9 buffers and amplifies the TX mixer output. Q14
keeps U9 fully turned off during receive. The low-level transmit
signal is passed through the RF band-pass filter on the Filter board
via J7.
D9-D13 form a fast, high-isolation T-R switch that allows the
appropriate RF band-pass filter to be shared between receive and
transmit. On transmit the signal is routed through D9 to the driver
transistor, Q6. On receive, D10, 11, and 12 are turned on,
bypassing the transmit stages.
Q7 is the class-C final amplifier. It operates at a nominal collector
impedance of 12.5 ohms, which is stepped up to 50 ohms by T4.
Q7's output is filtered by one of the low-pass filters on the Filter
board, with signals routed through J8. RF detector diode D15
samples some of the RF output voltage to provide a power output
indication. If the KAT1 antenna tuner is installed, its SWR
bridge/wattmeter output takes over from D15, via pin 5 of J8.

Appendix E, Troubleshooting
General Troubleshooting Procedure
 
Look for your problem in the Troubleshooting Tables.
 
Closely examine PC boards for poor solder joints and incorrect, broken or
missing components.
 
Follow the step-by-step receiver and transmitter Signal Tracing
procedures at the end of this section.
 
Check voltages using the DC Voltage Table at the end of this section.
Error Messages
If you see a message such as  E 3 0 on the LCD, look up the  corresponding
entry in the Troubleshooting Tables. Error messages can usually be cleared by
pressing any switch. However, the cause of the message should be investigated
before continuing to operate the transceiver.
Troubleshooting Tables
There are five troubleshooting tables (listed below). Within each table,
problems are identified by 2-digit numbers for cross-referencing purposes. In
most cases you’ll know which table to look in based on the symptoms you
observe. If in doubt, start with the General Troubleshooting table. Some
problem identifiers have corresponding error messages (see above).

 
DC input voltage must be > 8.5V
 
Remove all option boards and re-check
 
If +6V is too low (< 5.7V) go to 22
 
If +8V is too low (< 7.5V) go to 23
21  General problem
with switches or
potentiometers
 
Check switch resistance open/closed; check
R14, R15 and RP1
 
Check resistance of potentiometers; check
related connections to FP-J1
22  +6A or +6B
voltages too low
(< 5.7V)
 
Remove socketed ICs, front panel board,
filter board, and options individually
 
Inspect the entire 6A or 6B path on the RF
and Front Panel boards.
 
Check for regulator ICs installed backwards
 
Lift the output lead of the affected  regulator
and measure the voltage this lead; if the
voltage is still too low, replace the IC
 
Lift other component leads on the 6V line as
needed to find cause of excess loading
23  +8V too low
(< 7.5V)
 
Use techniques given for 6V regulators

 
LCD in backwards or bent pin; check for
shorts to ground on each LCD pin
 
MCU pin bent or broken (FP-U1)
 
LEDs swapped or installed backwards
25  Relay Problem
 
Relays installed backwards or not soldered
 
Check relay coil resistance, pins 1 and 10
 
I/O controller defective or backwards (27)
26  Possible MCU
problem
 
Check all DC voltages on FP-U1
 
Remove the Front Panel board and inspect
U1. Make sure it is not backwards, has no
bent pins, and is seated firmly in its socket.
 
Check oscillator components (X1, C1, C2).
 
Also see (33) if you suspect an error in a
menu parameter, etc.
27  Filter board not
plugged in, or I/O
controller (FIL-U1)
communication
problem
 
If you saw the message E 2 7 , the I/O
controller (IOC, FIL-U1) did not respond to
messages from the main processor (MCU,
FP-U1). Turn power OFF and back ON; if
you hear some relays switching, the IOC may
be OK, and the problem is likely to be with
the AuxBus (29)
 
If you do not hear any relays switching on
power-up, your IOC (FIL-U1) may be
defective. Inspect FIL-U1 to see if you have
installed it backwards or if any pins are bent.
 
With power ON, check all voltages
associated with U1. You should see 6V at
pins 1 and 14. See DC voltage table.
28  I/O controller data
error
 
If you saw the message E 2 8 , the I/O
controller (IOC, FIL-U1) sent an incorrect
response to the MCU (FP-U1). This may
indicate a firmware incompatibility.
29  AuxBus problem
 
Try removing each option board
 
If voltage at pin 13 of the IOC (FIL–U1), the
auxBus line may be shorted
 
Try tapping the B A N D  switch quickly while
watching pin 13. It should drop below 6V
briefly if the MCU (FP-U1) is sending a
message to the IOC.
 
Check the AuxBus signal at the MCU, pin 8
(FP-U1). The voltage should drop below 6V
briefly when the band is changed.

 
Verify that the Filter board is plugged in.
 
Check all voltages on the EEPROM (FP-U3)

Inspect FP-U3 and surrounding traces
 
Make sure FP-R16 is installed

VFO and Premixer (40-59)
Problem
Troubleshooting Steps
40  General VFO
problem;  frequency
jumps or drifts
 
Note: Some VFO drift will always be present
due to aging of components and heating or
cooling of the cabinet
 
The VFO will drift more if you used the
larger range (C2=120 pF).
 
Use C A L menu entry to check actual VFO
frequency (hold E D I T to show the operating
frequency calibration display,  then switch to
O S C using D I S P L A Y )
 
Make sure supply voltage is above 8.5V
 
If you used solder with water-soluble flux,
clean the board with hot water and a Q-tip
 
Make sure L1 leads are properly stripped
 
Check crystals on Filter board
41 Can't tune VFO (or
RIT/XIT offset)
 
Check actual VFO range (40)
 
Measure voltage on anode of RF-D3 (VFO
main varactor diode) while tuning VFO pot
 
Measure voltage on anode of RF-D4 (offset
varactor diode) while tuning the OFFSET pot
 
Varactors may be installed backwards
42  VFO inductor not
installed or VFO not
oscillating
 
If you see E 4 2 , the VFO signal is either
missing or is too low in amplitude to be
counted by the MCU (FP-U1).
 
Check all VFO components
 
Check the counter amplifier and related
components (FP-Q1, R11, R12)
 
Use signal tracing to determine where the
VFO signal is getting lost
45 VFO tunes the
wrong way
 
VFO pot (FP-R1) CCW and CW leads may
be reversed
46 VFO or RIT/XIT
range is too large, too
small, or shifted
low/high
 
Check actual VFO range (40)
 
Varactor diodes may be wrong type
 
Check all capacitors in VFO, esp. C2 and C7
 
See Alignment and Test, Part I.
Receiver (60-79)
Problem
Troubleshooting Steps
60  Low (or no) audio
output from receiver,
or general receiver
gain problem
 
If you hear normal audio output on one band
but not all bands, see 62
 
Make sure you have headphones or speaker
connected; turn AF GAIN clockwise
 
Check the key jack for a short to ground
 
Make sure the attenuator is turned off
 
Re-peak the band-pass filters
 
Check for ground shorts in the LPF and BPF
 
Turn the AF GAIN to maximum. If you don’t
hear any “hiss” at the receiver output,
troubleshoot the AF amplifier (65)
 
Check the 8V regulated supply voltage and
troubleshoot if necessary (20)
 
Try using signal tracing (see procedure later
in this section)
62  Signal loss only on
one band
 
Re-do alignment on affected band
 
Check the band-pass and low-pass filters and
crystal for this band
 
Check functioning of the associated relays
(change bands, then measure relay leads that
should be open or shorted for that band)
65  AF amplifier not
working
 
Use the S T L menu entry to set a sidetone
level of 31. If you hear a strong tone, the A.F.
amplifier (RF-U4) is probably working, and
the problem is likely to be with the preamp
(RF-U3) or other RF board circuits.
 
Signal trace through the receive chain
backwards by touching a tool or wire to
various points along the receive path
 
Check all DC voltages in the receiver
 
Inspect the A.F. amp and preamp circuits
70  AGC or S-meter
not working
 
Make sure the attenuator is off
 
Check voltages on RF-U1, U2, Q1, Q2, D2

Transmitter and Keyer (80-99)
Problem
Troubleshooting Steps
80  General
Transmitter problem
 
If power output is too low, go to 86
 
If power output slowly increases during key-
down, go to 88
 
If current drain on transmit is too high for the
given power level, go to 92
 
If the transmitter output power seems to be
unstable go to 88
 
If the transmitter stops transmitting by itself
go to 90
 
If the keyer isn’t working properly, go to 95
 
Try signal tracing
86  Power output is
low or zero
 
Check power output when using a 50Ω
dummy load; if the output is correct on a
dummy load but not when using an antenna,
your antenna is probably not matched
 
Check all component values in the RF
detector; you may have two resistors
swapped (R36, R37) or the wrong detector
diode (D15, should be 1N5711)
 
You may have a short in the LPF or BPF;
also check relays (25)
 
Examine T3 and T4; these must be wound as
indicated in part II of the RF board assembly
 
Look for toroid leads that are not completely
stripped or are soldered poorly
 
Check all DC voltages in the transmitter (RF
board, Q5/Q6/Q7, U8, U9)
 
If drive is lacking, R35 (RF board, TX
attenuator) can be made larger, at the expense
of power-setting resolution.
 
Make an RF probe and signal-trace through
the transmitter to find where signal is lost
(see probe and procedure later in this section)
 
Check for any components getting hot
 
Check for RF-Q7's tab shorted to the right
side panel (ground)
88  Power output
fluctuates
 
If you stay in key-down (TUNE) mode for
several seconds, it is normal to see some
increase in power; this is due heating of the
final amplifier transistor.
 
If power goes up and down significantly
during normal keying, you may have a
poorly-matched antenna OR you may have
power set too high for your battery or power
supply to handle; try reducing power
 
Make sure none of the diodes in the T-R
switch circuits are in backwards
 
If the transmitter is unstable (oscillating)
even when connected to a 50-Ω load, you
may have an incorrect component value or a
toroid-winding error (86)
90  Output power
drops to zero suddenly
 
If you have transmit power set too high for
your battery or power supply, the supply
voltage may drop so low on transmit that it
resets the MCU (FP-U1) or the I/O controller
(FIL-U1). Reduce power.
92  Current drain too
high on transmit
 
You may have power set higher than the final
amplifier can achieve for a given load or
power supply voltage, resulting in overdrive
of transmitter stages. Reduce power to see if
normal current drain is restored.
 
Damaged PA transistors or other components
could cause inefficiency in any stage of the
transmitter. Check all DC voltages and
components; signal trace if necessarily (86)
95  Keyer Problem
 
If the keyer is generally erratic when
transmitting and seems to get worse as power
is increased, you probably have RF leaking
into the keyline. Try bypassing your key with
.001 µF capacitors; also try 100 µH RF
chokes in series with the paddle connections.
 
Seek a better antenna match
 
Improve your ground system (if you have RF
problems, add two or more radials cut to 1/4-
wavelength at the affected frequency)

Signal Tracing
You can solve nearly all problems yourself by signal tracing using an RF probe
and signal source, such as the ones shown here.
RF Probe
The RF probe shown in Figure 1 converts RF signals to DC so they can be
measured using a DMM.

The probe tip (E1) should be no longer than 3” (see any ARRL Handbook for
ideas), and you should not touch the tip while taking measurements. Use an
alligator clip at E2, with a 4” (13 cm) lead.
Note: With this RF probe, DC voltage readings on your DMM will be
approximately equal to the signal voltage in Vrms (root-mean-square).
However, the error in the reading is quite significant for small signals (typ.
–50% at 50 mVrms). The signal tracing procedures take this error into account.
Crystal Oscillator
The simple crystal oscillator  shown in Figure 2 can be used in lieu of a
commercial signal generator. It will run on voltages as low as 8 V, but 12 V or
higher is recommended.
The components are not critical, and can vary 20% with little variation in
performance. Nearly any NPN RF transistor will work in the circuit. Crystal X1
should be chosen for the band in use.  The potentiometer can be any small
trimmer or panel mount unit, but should not wire-wound.

Receiver and VFO Signal Tracing
In the following steps you’ll use an RF probe, DMM, and a signal source to
find the stage where the received signal is getting lost or attenuated. You can
then use voltage tables and resistance checks to find the bad component or
connection. Space is provided at each step to record your measurements, which
can vary as much as 25% in most cases and still be acceptable. Test points and
components are on the RF board unless otherwise indicated.
1. 
Connect the RF probe’s output to your DMM’s +/- DC input jacks. Select a
2 or 3-V DC range.
2. 
The DMM should read close to 0.000 V DC, and the reading should
increase when you touch the RF probe tip with your finger.
3. 
Turn on the K1 and switch to the desired band. Use the menu to turn AGC
OFF. Set AF GAIN to minimum.
4. 
Connect the RF probe’s ground clip to the ground jumper near the VFO
inductor, L1. The probe tip will be touched to the points indicated in the
following steps.
5. 
VFO: U7, pin 1 (U7 is near the left edge of the RF board). Expected DMM
indication: .02-.04 V (DC). Actual: _______.
6. 
Premix crystal: U7, pin 7. Expected: .04-.25 V. Actual: _______.

                                                                          6
7. 
Premixer: U7, pin 4 or 5 (whichever is greater). Expected: .04-.25 V.
Actual: _______.
8. 
Premix band-pass filter: FIL-P1, pin 6. (FIL-P1 is an 8-pin connector on
the Filter board, near the crystals. Pin 6 is the third pin from the right end.)
Expected: .04-.15 V. Actual: _______. (Note: the expected voltage takes
into account the de-tuning effect of the RF probe. The signal level would
be higher if the filter was re-tuned to compensate for it.)
9. 
BFO: U2, pin 7. Expected: .015-.100 V. Actual: _______.
10. Connect a signal generator or test oscillator to the antenna jack. Set the
signal level to about 0.14 Vrms as indicated by the RF probe, with the
probe tip on pin 8 of FIL-P3 (right-hand end of the 8-pin connector on the
Filter board near the antenna jack).
11. Low-pass filter: FIL-P3, pin 1. Expected: .12-.16 V. Actual: ______.
12. T-R switch: FIL-P2, pin 8 (P2 is the front-center 8-pin connector on the
Filter board). Expected: .07-.12 V. Actual: _______.
13. RF band-pass filter: FIL-P2, pin 1. Expected: .06-.13 V. Actual: _____.
14. Attenuator and T1: U1, pin 1. Expected: .40-.70 V. Actual: ______.
15. Receive mixer: U1, pin 4. Expected: .50-.80 V. Actual: _______.
16. Post-mixer amp: R14, right end. Expected: .50-.80 V. Actual: ______.
17. Connect a pair of headphones or a speaker and adjust the AF GAIN so that
you can just hear some background noise. Tune the VFO until you can hear
the signal from your test generator peaked in the crystal filter. Since AGC
is turned off, the signal may be extremely loud and will probably be
clipping (distorted) at the AF output.
18. Crystal filter: U2, pin 1. Expected: .30-.50 V. Actual: _______. (Re-peak
the signal using the VFO as needed.)
19. Disconnect  the RF probe from the DMM.
20. Set up the DMM to read AC volts, 20 or 30-V meter range. Connect the   (-
) lead of the DMM to one of the ground test points using an alligator clip.
The (+) lead will be touched to the points indicated in the following steps.
21. Product detector (saturated output): U2, pin 4. Expected: .40-.80 V (AC
rms). Actual: _______. (Re-peak the signal using the VFO as needed.)
22. AF preamp: U3, pin 5. Expected: 2-4 V. Actual: _______.
23. AF amp: U4, pin 6. Output voltage should vary from 0 to about 4 or 5 V
as the AF GAIN control is varied.
Transmitter Signal Tracing
In the following steps an RF probe is used to determine where the transmitted
signal is getting lost or attenuated.  These checks are made from the bottom side
of the RF board so that the Filter board can be left plugged in. Each transmit
test point is clearly labeled, with a small arrow pointing to the appropriate PC
board pad. You’ll want to refer to the transmitter schematic (K1 RF Board,
sheet 2) as you perform the measurements.
1. 
Do the VFO and receiver signal tracing first to check VFO/premix signals.
2. 
Connect a dummy load to the antenna jack.
3. 
Turn the K1 upside-down and remove the bottom cover.
4. 
Install a very short jumper from the point labeled DRV to ground. This
allows measurement of all low-level transmit stages.
5. 
Turn on the K1 and switch to the desired band. Set the power level to 3
watts using the OUT menu entry.
6. 
Connect the RF probe’s ground clip to the ground jumper on the bottom of
the RF board, near the center. Connect the RF probe’s output to the DMM,
and set the DMM for DC volts (2 or 3 V scale).
In the remaining steps, touch the RF probe tip to the indicated points and enter
TUNE mode to take a reading. (Hold WPM+/WPM- together to activate
TUNE.) Cancel TUNE after each reading by tapping any other switch.
Note: Do not key the transmitter for more than about 10 seconds at a time.
7. 
PRE (premix): Expected: .04-.09 V (DC). Actual: _______.
8. 
ATTN (TX attenuator): Expected: .02-.05 V. Actual: _______.
9. 
OSC (TX 4.915 MHz): Expected: .01-.04 V. Actual: _______.
10. MIX (TX mixer): Expected: 0.1-0.2 V. Actual: _______.
11. BUF (TX buffer): Expected: 1.5-2.0 V. Actual: _______.
12. TR1 (first TX T-R): Expected: 0.5-1.0 V. Actual: _______.
13. BPF (band-pass filter): Expected: 0.5-1.0 V. Actual: _______.
14. TR2 (second TX T-R): Expected: 0.5-1.0 V. Actual: _______.
15. TR3 (receive signal shunt): Expected: < .01 V. Actual: _______.
16. Remove the short from DRV to ground. Set DMM scale to 20 or 30 V.
17. DRV (driver): Expected: 0.9-1.6 V. Actual: _______.
18. PA (power amp): Expected: 10-15 V. Actual: _______.
19. ANT (low-pass filter): Expected: 10-12 V. Actual: _______.
20. Disconnect the  RF probe. (The last measurement is DC volts, not RF.)
21. RFD (RF output detector): Expected: 1.7-2.0 V. Actual: _______.

DC Voltage Table
NOTES: Measurements listed for FIL-U1 apply only to the two-band Filter board; for 4-band Filter board voltages, refer to the KFL1-4
manual. Measurements were made with a 50-ohm dummy load connected and a supply voltage of 14 V. In general, your measurements should
be within 10% of the values shown. Pins NOT listed in the table should indicate 0.0 volts DC.  Pins marked with (*)  are hard to measure
due to noise pickup. Shaded areas show transmit-mode measurements (using TUNE), made with the Filter board removed.
Reference designators are prefixed with the board identifier: “FP” = front panel board, “RF” = RF board, “FIL” = filter board.
