FT-891 Operating Manual
Installing the Radio
Antenna considerations
The FT-891 is designed for 50 Ohm resistive impedance at the amateur operating frequencies.
Select the proper antenna (dipole antenna, YAGI antenna, cubical quad antenna, etc.) suitable 
for the chosen operation and bands.
Construct the antenna and coaxial cable, or use a suitable antenna tuner, to maintain the impedance
presented to the FT-891 antenna connector for an SWR of 1.5 or less. Careful preparation of the 
antenna and/or tuner will permit maximum performance and protect the transceiver from damage.
High voltages may be present on the antenna; install it so it will not be easily touched when in 
operation. 
r	Create a loop (slack) in the co-axial cable directly underneath the antenna and fasten it so that the 
weight of the cable does not pull on the antenna or connector itself.
r	Install the antenna taking into consideration the securing supports and how the guying wires are 
positioned, so that the antenna does not fall over or get blown away in strong winds.
About coaxial Cable
Use high-quality 50-Ohm coaxial cable for the lead-in to your FT-891 transceiver.
Connection of Antenna and Power Cables
Please follow the outline in the illustration regarding the proper connection of antenna coaxial cables.
FUSE: 25 A

supplying DC 13.8 V, a current capacity of 
23 A or more.
BLACK
To prevent damage from lightning, atmospheric 
electricity, electrical shock etc., please provide a good 
earth ground. Use a short, thick, braided cable to 
connect your station equipment to the buried ground rod (or 
alternative earth ground system).
Important precautions for mobile radio operation
r	The use of protective tape or covering is recommended to protect the wiring and the power cord 
inside the vehicle.
r	When installing the unit inside a vehicle, locate the radio, antenna, co-axial cable, etc. at least 20 
cm (8 inches) away from the following control equipment:

Clarifier (Offsets the receive frequency on the SSB/CW mode)
The 
 [CLAR] key and 
 MULTI function knob are used to offset the receive frequency, 
the transmit frequency, or both, from the VFO-A frequency setting. A small four digit 
indication on the display will show the current Clarifier offset. The Clarifier functions on the 
FT-891 allow offsetting the receive and transmit frequencies (up to ±9.998 kHz), without 
actually re-tuning, and then activating it by pressing Clarifier 
 [CLAR] key. This feature 
is ideal for following a drifting station, or for setting the small frequency offsets sometimes 
utilized in DX “Split” work.
r	To change the clarifier operation (RX/TX/TRX), utilize Menu mode “05-18 [CLAR 
SELECT]”.The factory default setting is “RX”.
r	The RX clarifier does not change the transmit frequency, but permits slight adjustment 
of the receiver for improved audio.
r	Remember to reset the Clarifier offset to zero when the QSO is completed, so the 
transmit and the receive frequencies will be combined again.
Here is the technique for utilizing the Clarifier:
1.	Press the 
 [CLAR] key. The programmed 
offset will be applied to the receive frequen-
cy.
2.	Rotation of the 
 MULTI function knob will 
allow adjustment of the initial offset on the 
fly. Offsets of up to ±9.998 kHz may be set 
using the Clarifier.
3.	To cancel Clarifier operation, press the 
[CLAR] key.
r	Turning the Clarifier off merely cancels 
the application of the programmed offset 
from the receive and/or the transmit fre-
quencies. To clear the Clarifier offset, and 
reset it to “zero”, press and hold the 
 
MULTI function knob.
r	To change the clarifier operation (RX/
TX/TRX), utilize Menu mode “05-18 
[CLAR SELECT]”.

IF SHIFT Operation (SSB/CW/RTTY/DATA Modes)
IF SHIFT permits moving the DSP filter passband higher or lower, without changing the 
pitch of the incoming signal, and thus reduces or eliminates interference. Because the 
tuned carrier frequency is not varied, there is no need to retune the operating frequency 
to eliminate the interference. The total passband tuning range for the IF SHIFT system is 
±1.2 kHz.
1.	Press the assigned 
 [A](SFT) key to acti-
vate the IF SHIFT (
 will appear), the 
SHIFT adjustment pop-up screen will be dis-
played.
r If the IF SHIFT function is not assigned 
to an

tion knob to select the “SFT” à Press and 
hold any of the 
 [A]/[B]/[C] keys to as-
sign the IF SHIFT function.
r Rotate the 
 MULTI function knob to select “SFT” in the “FUNCTION-1” list screen, 
and then press the knob, to switch the IF SHIFT function ON/OFF.
2.	Rotate the 
 MULTI function knob to the left or right to reduce interfering signals.
NOTE:	To reset the IF SHIFT tuning to the factory default value, press and hold the 
 
MULTI function knob.
3.	Press any key except the 
 [A], [B], [C], 
 [CLAR] keys, or the 
 MULTI function 
knob to save the new setting and return to normal operation.
r	 Press the

Referring to Figure (A), note the de-
piction of the IF DSP filter as the thick 
line, with 
 MULTI function knob in 
the 12 o’clock position. In Figure (B), 
an interfering signal has appeared in-
side the original passband. In Figure 
(C), you can see the effect of rotating 
the
