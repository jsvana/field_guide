BASIC MANUAL
PRECAUTIONS
	
RDANGER HIGH RF VOLTAGE! NEVER touch an 
antenna, an antenna connector, or a ground terminal 
while transmitting. This could cause an electrical 
shock or burn.
	
RDANGER! NEVER operate the transceiver near 
unshielded electrical blasting caps or in an explosive 
atmosphere. This could cause an explosion and 
death.
	
RWARNING RF EXPOSURE! This transceiver 
emits Radio Frequency (RF) energy. Extreme caution 
should be observed when operating this transceiver. 
If you have any questions regarding RF exposure 
and safety standards please refer to the Federal 
Communications Commission Office of Engineering 
and Technology’s report on Evaluating Compliance 
with FCC Guidelines for Human Radio Frequency 
Electromagnetic Fields (OET Bulletin 65).
	
RWARNING! NEVER operate the transceiver with 
earphones, a headset, or other audio accessories at 
high volume levels. If you experience a ringing in your 
ears, reduce the volume or discontinue use.
	
RWARNING! NEVER apply AC power to the  
[DC 13.8 V] socket on the transceiver rear panel. This 
could cause a fire or damage the transceiver.
	
RWARNING! NEVER apply more than 16 V DC to 
the [DC 13.8 V] socket on the transceiver rear panel. 
This could cause a fire or damage the transceiver.
	
RWARNING! NEVER reverse the DC power cable 
polarity. This could cause a fire or damage the 
transceiver.
	
RWARNING! NEVER remove the fuse holder on the 
DC power cable. Excessive current caused by a short 
could cause a fire or damage the transceiver.
	
RWARNING! NEVER let metal, wire or other objects 
contact the inside of the transceiver, or make incorrect 
contact with connectors. This could cause an electric 
shock or damage the transceiver.
	
RWARNING! NEVER operate or touch the 
transceiver with wet hands. This could cause an 
electric shock or damage to the transceiver.
	
RWARNING! NEVER operate the equipment if 
you notice an abnormal odor, sound or smoke. 
Immediately turn OFF the power and/or remove 
the DC power cables. Contact your Icom dealer or 
distributor for advice.
	
RWARNING! NEVER put the transceiver on an 
unstable place where the transceiver may suddenly 
move or fall. This could cause an injury or damage the 
transceiver.
	
RWARNING! NEVER operate the transceiver during 
a lightning storm. It may result in an electric shock, 
cause a fire or damage the transceiver. Always 
disconnect the power cables and antenna before a 
storm.
CAUTION: DO NOT expose the transceiver to 
rain, snow or any liquids. They could damage the 
transceiver.
CAUTION: DO NOT operate the transceiver unless 
the antenna and cables are securely attached to 
the transceiver, and that the antenna and cables 
are dry before attachment. Exposing the inside of 
the transceiver to dust or water will result in serious 
damage to the transceiver.
CAUTION: DO NOT change the internal settings 
of the transceiver. This could reduce transceiver 
performance and/or damage to the transceiver. The 
transceiver warranty does not cover any problems 
caused by unauthorized internal adjustments.
CAUTION: DO NOT install or place the transceiver 
in a place without adequate ventilation, or block any 
cooling vents on the top, rear, sides or bottom of the 
transceiver or the cooling fan. Heat dissipation may be 
reduced and damage the transceiver.
CAUTION: DO NOT use harsh solvents such as 
Benzine or alcohol when cleaning. This could damage 
the transceiver surfaces. If the surface becomes dusty 
or dirty, wipe it clean with a soft, dry cloth.
CAUTION: DO NOT use or leave the transceiver 
in areas with temperatures below –10°C (+14°F) or 
above +60°C (+140°F).
CAUTION: DO NOT place the transceiver in 
excessively dusty environments. This could damage 
the transceiver.
CAUTION: DO NOT set the transceiver’s RF output 
power to more than a connected linear amplifier’s 
maximum input level. Otherwise, the linear amplifier 
will be damaged.
CAUTION: DO NOT use non-Icom microphones.

BASIC MANUAL
 
INSTALLATION NOTES
For amateur base station installations it is recommended 
that the forward clearance in front of the antenna array is 
calculated relative to the EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated 
Power). The clearance height below the antenna array can 
be determined in most cases from the RF power at the 
antenna input terminals.
As different exposure limits have been recommended for 
different frequencies, a relative table shows a guideline for 
installation considerations.
Below 30 MHz, the recommended limits are specified in 
terms of V/m or A/m fields as they are likely to fall within the 
near-field region. Similarly, the antennas may be physically 
short in terms of electrical length and that the installation will 
require some antenna matching device which can create 
local, high intensity magnetic fields. Analysis of such MF 
installations is best considered in association with published 
guidance notes such as the FCC OET Bulletin 65 Edition 
97-01 and its annexes relative to amateur transmitter 
installations. The EC recommended limits are almost 
identical to the FCC specified ‘uncontrolled’ limits and tables 
exist that show pre-calculated safe distances for different 
antenna types for different frequency bands. Further 
information can be found at https://www.arrl.org/.
	• Typical amateur radio installation
Exposure distance assumes that the predominant radiation 
pattern is forward and that radiation vertically downwards 
is at unity gain (sidelobe suppression is equal to main lobe 
gain). This is true of almost every gain antenna today.
Exposed persons are assumed to be beneath the antenna 
array and have a typical height of 1.8 m.
The figures assume the worst case emission of a constant 
carrier.
For the bands 10 MHz and higher the following power 
density limits have been recommended:
10–50 MHz 2 W/sq m
Vertical clearance by EIRP output
	
      1 Watts	
2.1 m
	
    10 Watts	
2.8 m
	
    25 Watts	
3.4 m
	
  100 Watts	
5 m
	
1000 Watts	
12 m
Forward clearance by EIRP output
	
100 Watts	
2 m
	
1000 Watts	
6.5 m
	
10,000 Watts	
20 m
	
100,000 Watts	
65 m
In all cases any possible risk depends on the transmitter 
being activated for long periods. (actual recommendation 
limits are specified as an average during 6 minutes)
Normally the transmitter is not active for long periods of 
time. Some radio licenses will require that a timer circuit 
automatically cuts the transmitter after 1–2 minutes etc.
Similarly some types of emission, i.e., SSB, CW, AM etc. 
have a lower ‘average’ output power and the assessed risk 
is even lower.
Turn OFF the transceiver’s power and disconnect the 
DC power cable when you will not use the transceiver 
for long period of time.
The LCD display may have cosmetic imperfections 
that appear as small dark or light spots. This is not a 
malfunction or defect, but a normal characteristic of 
LCD displays.
Operate the transceiver that complies with your local 
laws and regulations.
Depending on countries and/or regions, transceiver’s 
output power and/or operations on specific 
frequencies may be restricted to avoid interferences 
with existing radio stations or services.

INSTALLATION AND CONNECTIONS
Selecting a location
Select a location for the transceiver that allows 
adequate air circulation, free from extreme heat, cold, 
or vibration, and other electromagnetic sources.
Never place the transceiver in areas such as:
	• Out of the specified temperature range for the 
transceiver (–10°C ~ +60°C, +14°F ~ +140°F).
	• An unstable place that slopes or vibrates.
	• In direct sunlight.
	• High humidity and temperature environments.
	• Dusty environments.
	• Noisy environments.
Using the desktop stand
The transceiver has a stand for desktop use.
Stand
CAUTION: DO NOT hold the stand, dials, and 
controls when you carry the transceiver. This may 
damage them.
Heat dissipation
	• NEVER install the transceiver in a place without 
adequate ventilation. Heat dissipation may be 
reduced, and the transceiver may be damaged.
	• DO NOT place the transceiver against walls or put 
anything on top of the transceiver. This may block 
airflow and overheat the transceiver.
	• DO NOT touch the transceiver after transmitting 
continuously for long periods of time. The 
transceiver may become hot.
Grounding
To prevent electrical shock, television interference 
(TVI), broadcast interference (BCI) and other 
problems, ground the transceiver using the ground 
terminal [GND] on the rear panel.
For best results, connect a heavy gauge wire or strap 
to a long ground rod. Make the distance between the 
[GND] terminal and the ground as short as possible.
GND

DConnecting a non-Icom linear amplifier
See the illustration below to connect a non-Icom linear amplifier.
	
LWe recommend that you use a linear amplifier with a specified input power of 100 watts or more. If you use an amplifier with 
a specified drive level of less than 100 watts, adjust the IC-7300MK2’s output power to the specified level before transmitting. 
Otherwise, the linear amplifier may be damaged.
*1 When you connect a coaxial cable to [INPUT 1], connect to [REMOTE 1] and [ACC 1]. 
When you connect a coaxial cable to [INPUT 2], connect to [REMOTE 2] and [ACC 2].
*2 To connect the second Icom exciter, use the optional OPK-5 cable kit.
	
R WARNING!
	• The maximum signal level of the [SEND] jack is 16 V/0.5 A DC. Use an external unit if your non-Icom linear amplifier 
requires a control voltage and/or current greater than specified.
	• The ALC input level must be in the range 0 to –6 V. The transceiver does not accept a positive voltage. Non-matched ALC 
and RF power settings could overheat or damage the linear amplifier.
	• When using a linear amplifier such as the IC-PW2, set the RF POWER in the Multi-function menu to keep the ALC meter in 
the red zone.

each mode, and you can select them on the FILTER 
screen.
You can set the IF filter to wide (FIL 1), mid (FIL 2), or 
narrow (FIL 3).
1.	 Select the operating mode. (Example: USB)
2.	 Touch the IF Filter indicator for 1 second. 
	• Opens the FILTER (SSB) screen.

by touching this key for 1 second.
5.	 Rotate MAIN DIAL  to select the passband width.
	
LYou cannot change the passband width in the FM or 
FM-D mode.
	
LWhen you change the passband width, the Digital 
Twin PBT setting value is reset to the center position.
	
L“BPF” is displayed when a bandwidth is set to  
500 Hz or less in the SSB, CW, or RTTY mode.
6.	 To close the FILTER screen, push EXIT .
TIP: When you set the IF filter to FIL2 or FIL3 in the

Selecting the IF filter
Selecting the IF filter shape
SSB and CW modes
You can set the IF filter shape for each mode.
1.	 Select the operating mode. (Example: USB)
2.	 Touch the filter icon for 1 second.
	• Opens the FILTER (SSB) screen.
3.	 Touch [SHARP] or [SOFT]. 
4.	 To close the FILTER screen, push EXIT .
	• SHARP 
This selection is to emphasize the passband width 
of the filter. The filter has an almost ideal shape 
factor. Signals that are out of the passband are 
extremely filtered out, and it gives you better audio 
quality.
	• SOFT 
The filter shoulders are roundly formed as in analog 
filters. This decreases noise components in the 
high and low frequencies of the filter passband, 
and increases the S/N of the target signal. These 
characteristics play an effective role in picking up 
very weak signals. The shape factor is retained, 
and the sharpness of the bandpass is excellent.

ANTENNA TUNER OPERATION
The internal automatic antenna tuner automatically 
matches the transceiver to the antenna within the 
range of 16.7 ~ 150 Ω (SWR of less than 3:1).
After the tuner matches an antenna, the latching 
relay combinations are memorized as a preset point 
for each frequency. Therefore, when you change 
the frequency, the latching relay combinations are 
automatically preset to the memorized point.
	
LWhen you install a new antenna, or you want to change 
the antenna settings, you can clear all of the internal 
antenna tuner preset points with the “<<Preset Memory 
Clear>>” item on the TUNER set screen. (p. 52)
MENU  » SET > Function > Tuner >  
<<Preset Memory Clear>>
NOTE:
	• If the SWR is higher than about 1.5:1, hold down 
TUNER  for 1 second to start manual tuning.
	• When the transceiver receives a strong physical 
shock, the internal latching relays may be returned 
to an unlatched condition. In that case, push 
TUNER  to turn OFF the tuner, then turn it ON 
again to reset all latching relays.
	
DUsing the Internal antenna tuner

DManual tuning
You can manually match the antenna before 
transmitting for the first time.
1.	 Hold down TUNER  for 1 second to start manual 
tuning.
	• The tuner reduces the SWR to less than 1.5:1 after  
2 ~ 3 seconds of tuning.
	
LWhile tuning, 
 blinks red.
2.	 After matching, 
 is displayed.
	
LIf the tuner cannot tune, the tuning circuit is 
automatically bypassed and 
 (blinks red) goes 
out.
	
DPTT Tuner start
The tuner is always activated when [PTT] is pushed 
after the frequency is changed (more than 1% from 
the last-tuned frequency). This function matches the 
antenna for the first transmission on a new frequency.
	
LYou can turn OFF this function in the “PTT Start” item on 
the TUNER screen. (p. 52)
MENU  » SET > Function > Tuner > PTT Start
TIP: If the tuner cannot match the antenna
Even if the tuner cannot match the antenna on the 
first attempt, it may succeed by repeating the tuning 
several times.

4.	 To start manual tuning while 
 is displayed, 
hold down TUNER  for 1 second.
5.	 To turn OFF (bypassed) the AH-730 or AH-740, 
push TUNER .
NOTE: When the wire antenna cannot be tuned, 
confirm the wire length and connection. 
Note that the AH-730 cannot tune a wire that is a ½λ 
long or on a multiple of that frequency.
	
DUsing the IC-PW2
When you use the internal antenna tuner of the  
IC-PW2, be sure to turn OFF the IC-7300MK2’s 
internal antenna tuner before connecting it.
To tune at the desired operating frequency, do manual 
tuning on the IC-PW2.
	• To tune to the selected operating frequency, the IC-PW2’s 
linked manual tuning operation is required. 
By holding down TUNER  on the IC-PW2 for 1 second, the 
transceiver automatically starts transmitting to perform 
the linked manual tuning.
	
LDuring the linked manual tuning, the meter readout of the 
transceiver can be changed.
	
LTo cancel the linked manual tuning, push TUNER  on the 
IC-7300MK2. 
When the linked manual tuning is canceled, 
 (blinks 
red) goes out.
	
LSee the IC-PW2 instruction manual for details.
	
DUsing an external antenna tuner
When you use a non-Icom external antenna tuner, 
be sure to turn OFF the internal antenna tuner before 
connecting it.
Otherwise, the tuning may fail because both antenna 
tuners (internal and external) will simultaneously start 
tuning.
See the antenna tuner’s instruction manual for details.
NOTE: Be sure not to connect the antenna tuner 
without an antenna connected. This could damage 
the transceiver or external antenna tuner.
TIP: If the SWR is not reduced to 2:1 after retuning, 
see “If the tuner cannot match the antenna” for 
details. (p. 46)
About the external antenna tuner
The optional AH-730 antenna tuner matches the IC-7300MK2 to a long wire antenna more than 7 m/23 ft long 
(1.8 MHz to 54 MHz).
The optional AH-740 automatic tuning antenna covers a 2.5 to 30 MHz range with a supplied whip antenna.
	
RDANGER HIGH VOLTAGE! NEVER touch the antenna element while tuning or transmitting. Always install it in 
a secure place.
NEVER operate the AH-730 or AH-740 without an antenna connected. The tuner and transceiver will be damaged.

NOTE: The backup battery for the internal clock
The IC-7300MK2 has a rechargeable Lithium 
battery to back up the internal clock. If you connect 
the transceiver to a power source, the battery is 
charged, and it keeps the correct clock setting.
However, if you do not connect the transceiver to a 
power source for a long period of time, the battery 
will discharge. In that case, the transceiver resets the 
internal clock.
If you do not use the transceiver for a long period 
of time, we recommend that you connect the 
transceiver to a power source at least once a 
month. The charging period is two days whether the 
transceiver’s power is ON or OFF.

*1 When the SEND terminal controls an inductive load, such 
as a relay, a counter-electromotive force can malfunction 
or damage the transceiver. To prevent this, we 
recommend adding a switching diode, such as a 1SS133, 
on the load side of the circuit to absorb the counter-
electromotive force.
	
LWhen the diode is added, a delay in relay switching 
may occur. Be sure to check its switching action before 
operating.

ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY
zlib 1.2.8 is a general purpose data 
compression library. All the code is thread 
safe. The data format used by the zlib 
library is described by RFCs (Request for 
Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://
tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib format), 
rfc1951 (deflate format) and rfc1952 (gzip 
format).
All functions of the compression library are 
documented in the file zlib.h (volunteer to 
write man pages welcome, contact zlib@
gzip.org). A usage example of the library is 
given in the file test/example.c which also 
tests that the library is working correctly. 
Another example is given in the file test/
minigzip.c. The compression library itself 
is composed of all source files in the root 
directory.
To compile all files and run the test program, 
follow the instructions given at the top of 
Makefile.in. In short ″./configure; make test″, 
and if that goes well, ″make install″ should 
work for most flavors of Unix. For Windows, 
use one of the special makefiles in win32/ or 
contrib/vstudio/ . For VMS, use make_vms.
com.
Questions about zlib should be sent to 
<zlib@gzip.org>, or to Gilles Vollant <info@
winimage.com> for the Windows DLL 
version. The zlib home page is http://zlib.
net/ . Before reporting a problem, please 
check this site to verify that you have the 
latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest 
version and check whether the problem still 
exists or not.
PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://zlib.net/
zlib_faq.html before asking for help.
Mark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote 
an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997 
issue of Dr. Dobb’s Journal; a copy of the 
article is available at http://marknelson.
us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/ .
The changes made in version 1.2.8 are 
documented in the file ChangeLog.
Unsupported third party contributions are 
provided in directory contrib/ .
zlib is available in Java using the java.
util.zip package, documented at http://
java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/
Programming/compression/ .
A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul 
Marquess <pmqs@cpan.org> is available 
at CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive 
Network) sites, including http://search.cpan.
org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/ .
A Python interface to zlib written by 
A.M.Kuchling <amk@amk.ca> is available 
in Python 1.5 and later versions, see http://
docs.python.org/library/zlib.html .
zlib is built into tcl: http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610 .
An experimental package to read and write 
files in .zip format, written on top of zlib 
by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>, 
is available in the contrib/minizip directory 
of zlib.
Notes for some targets:
- For Windows DLL versions, please see 
win32/DLL_FAQ.txt
- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled 
without any optimization. With - O, one 
libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit 
mode (with the -n32 compiler flag). 
The compiler bug has been reported to 
SGI.
- zlib doesn’t work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 
3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works 
when compiled with cc.
- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) 
on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is 
necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. 
This is done by configure.
- zlib doesn’t work on HP-UX 9.05 with 
some versions of /bin/cc. It works with 
other compilers. Use “make test” to check 
your compiler.
- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or 
BEOS.
- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.
sourceforge.net/
Acknowledgments:
The deflate format used by zlib was 
defined by Phil Katz. The deflate and zlib 
specifications were written by L. Peter 
Deutsch. Thanks to all the people who 
reported problems and suggested various 
improvements in zlib; they are too numerous 
to cite here.
