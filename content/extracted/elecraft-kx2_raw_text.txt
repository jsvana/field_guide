Introduction 
The Elecraft KX2 is a compact 80-10 m, SSB/CW/AM/FM/data transceiver designed for portable, mobile, 
and hand-held operation. Weighing just 13 oz. (0.35 kg), it’s the perfect “grab and go” HF radio. 
Despite its small size and low current drain, the KX2 is a full-featured HF transciever, with up to 15 W 
output. Its powerful digital signal processor (DSP) provides dual watch, built-in PSK and RTTY modes, 
digital voice recorder, stereo audio, EQ, noise reduction, and various filtering functions. The KX2 can be 
configured as a complete station, with internal ATU (KXAT2), Elecraft 4’ whip antenna (e.g. AX1 or AX2), 
attached keyer paddle (KXPD2), internal battery (KXBT2), and internal battery charger (KXIBC2). 
Since the KX2 is a software-defined-radio (SDR), you’ll be able to add new features via free firmware 
upgrades. For mobile and home use, you can boost the KX2’s output to 100 watts with the optional 
KXPA100 amplifier. The KXIB2 internal battery charger adds a real-time clock. 
When your next adventure begins—whether at home or in the field—your KX2 will be ready.

Installation  
  CAUTION 
§ 
Be careful when plugging in cables. Avoid 
sideways pressure that might damage the jacks. 
§ 
Avoid direct exposure to rain or snow (the KX2 
is not waterproof). 
§ 
Avoid operating at very high temperatures.  
§ 
Prior to opening the enclosure, touch a grounded, 
unpainted metal surface to avoid static discharge. 
 
Operating Position 
As shown below, the tilt leg on the back of the KX2 can 
be used to optimize the viewing angle. Loosen the rear 
thumbscrew to adjust the tilt leg. The KX2 can also be 
operated hand-held, either vertically or horizontally. 
 
Power Supply 
For fixed-station use, a low-noise 12-14 VDC power 
supply or battery is recommended. For lightweight 
portable operation, an internal battery can be used. 
  See next page for internal battery installation. 
Batteries or power supplies can be plugged in from 
inside, outside, or both. The internal and external DC 
jacks are identical, and are diode-isolated from each 
other. The higher voltage will power the transceiver. 
  Power output varies with supply voltage.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An external power supply or battery can be connected 
to the  9-15 V jack on the left side panel (see above). 
The center pin is (+). The plug can be a Switchcraft 
model S760 or similar (2.1 mm aperture, 5.5 mm dia.). 
The white striped wire on the supplied cable is (+).  
Trim the cable to the desired length.

Internal Battery  
The KXBT2, shown here installed, 
is an 11 V, 2.6 Ah li-ion battery 
with protective circuitry.  
Battery installation: 
• 
Loosen the two thumb nuts at 
the ends of the bottom cover. 
• 
Rotate the cover open, 
keeping  speaker wires 
captivated in the location 
shown at right. 
• 
Place the battery as shown and 
plug it into the internal jack. 
• 
Make sure battery wires are 
tucked inside, beside the plug. 
• 
Install the bottom cover. 
• 
Tighten the two thumb nuts 
firmly to keep the bottom 
cover in place. 
Battery removal:    
• 
Open the bottom cover as 
described above.  
• 
Pull the battery plug out 
slowly, using the provided 
nylon pull-loop. Do not pull 
on the battery pack wires.  
• 
Replace the bottom cover and 
tighten the thumb nuts firmly. 
 
 
Note: Speaker wires 
must be routed between 
the small band-pass filter 
board and the chassis.

Using the Battery Safely 
  Misusing a lithium-ion battery may cause it to 
get hot, rupture, or ignite and cause serious injury; 
or result in loss of performance and shortened life. 
The KXBT2 battery pack weighs only 4.8 oz, and can 
provide up to 8 hours of typical transceive operation 
and up to 10 W power output. To ensure safe 
operation, read the supplied battery information. 
The pack is fitted with a 2.1 mm DC barrel plug. The 
KX2 has two DC barrel jacks: one inside, and one on 
the left side panel. These jacks are isolated from each 
other, but either can power the KX2. You can plug in 
an internal battery and an external supply, and the 
radio will operate from whichever is higher in voltage. 
Battery Charging – Internal or External 
  The battery must be charged using only the 
KXBC2 external fast charger OR the KXIBC2 
internal charger.  
Internal Charging (KXIBC2):  Internal charging 
occurs if a KXIBC2 is installed and a suitable power 
source is connected (~14 V nominal). A yellow LED 
on the back of the KX2 lights when charging is in 
progress. Refer to the KXIBC2 manual for details. 
External Charging (KXBC2): First remove the 
battery as described on the previous page. Plug the 
battery into the jack on the charger, then plug the 
charger into a 120 VAC outlet. The charger’s LED will 
be red during charging, and GREEN when charge is 
complete. A full charge typically takes 1 to 2 hours. 
Amp Hour Metering 
The KX2 includes an amp hour meter function that 
allows you to better estimate remaining battery life. 
See pg. 23 for the associated special display function, 
as well as the AMP HRS menu entry. 
Preserving Clock Time During Charging 
The KXIBC2 and KXIO2 option modules include a 
real-time clock (RTC), useful for logging (see 
LOGGING menu entry). RTC circuitry is powered by 
the battery or power supply connected to the KX2 
(internal or external).  
When no power supply or battery is connected, the 
RTC’s time registers are preserved for up to 2 hours by 
a supercapacitor on the KXIO2 module. In most cases 
this allows sufficient time to remove the battery from 
the KX2, charge it, and reinstall it without losing the 
time setting. 
Utility Mounting Points (Bottom Cover) 
The KX2’s bottom cover has two threaded fasteners 
(4-40 PEM nuts) for light-duty applications. For 
example, they could be used to attach the transceiver to 
a clipboard for field logging, or for storage of a 
counterpoise wire. 
  CAUTION: These fasteners are not intended 
for use with a mobile mount. Also, do not allow 
screws or other hardware to protrude more than 
0.1” into the interior of the KX2.  
 

============================================================

CW Key/Keyer Paddle  
The KX2 has two CW keying inputs: 
Attached Keyer Paddle: A KXPD2 keyer paddle can 
be attached to the front of the KX2 via two thumb 
screws. (A KXPD3 can also be used, but the KX2’s tilt 
angle favors the shorter KXPD2.) Use the CW KEY2  
menu entry to reverse the dot/dash sides.  
KEY Jack: This jack can be used with any hand key, 
keyer paddle, or other keying device, as configured by 
the CW KEY1 menu entry. 
  A stereo plug is required at the KEY jack, even 
if only the tip contact is being used. 
 
Headphones and Speakers 
The 3.5 mm PHONES jack accommodates 
headphones or one or two externally amplified 
speakers. Mono or stereo plugs can be used. Stereo 
audio allows the use of dual watch and audio effects 
(pg. 25).  
Built-In Speaker: The speaker, located on the bottom 
cover, sounds best when the tilt foot is used. 
  Headphones or external speakers will provide 
greater bass response than the internal speaker. 
Mobile installations:  For mobile use, amplified 
mobile speakers or an aux input on your car’s stereo 
can be connected to the PHONES jack. Another 
alternative is to use a device that retransmits the KX2’s 
audio output in the FM broadcast band.  
Internal Microphone 
For emergency or hand-held use, the KX2 includes a 
built-in mic, located to the left of the AF/MON control. 
(There’s a small hole in the panel at this location.) The 
built-in mic is automatically turned on when no 
external mic is plugged in. Tap XMIT to transmit. 
  To prevent acoustic feedback, the transmit voice 
monitor function (MON) is disabled when using the 
internal mic with the internal speaker. 
External Microphone 
The 3.5 mm MIC jack is compatible with the Elecraft 
MH3 hand mic, which provides PTT as well as VFO 
UP/DN buttons. For the MH3, set the MIC BIAS menu 
entry to ON, and MIC BTN to PTT UP.DN.  
 
MIC Jack Pinout 
Sleeve:  Shield ground 
Ring2:  Logic ground 
Ring1:  PTT/UP/DN 
Tip:      Mic audio 
The KX2 will work with many other mics, including 
“mini” mics intended to plug directly into a computer. 
Refer to the MIC BIAS and MIC BTN menu entries to 
set up the KX2 for use with your mic or headset.

Computer/Amp Keying (ACC) 
The 3.5 mm accessory jack (ACC) facilitates firmware 
updates and remote control of the KX2 via a computer, 
and/or connection to an Elecraft KXPA100 amp. In 
either case, a standard stereo plug can be used (see 
sleeve, ring 1, and tip connections below). The 
supplied KXUSB cable can be used for this purpose. 
 
ACC Jack Pinout 
Sleeve:  Ground 
Ring 2:  *Key Out  
Ring 1:  TX Data 
Tip:       RX Data 
* For external ampflier keying, the ACC jack’s key out 
signal (on Ring 2) may also be needed, as described at 
right. In this case a 4-circuit (TRRS) plug is required. 
Computer Applications 
KX2 Utility is required for firmware configuration and 
updates (pg. 34). The utility program also provides a 
CW/data terminal function. Our Elecraft Frequency 
Memory Editor can be used to set up frequency 
memories. 
Many logging, contesting, and control programs are 
available from third parties. If the KX2 is not 
specifically supported, try using Elecraft KX3 or K3. 
Amplifier Keying 
The ACC jack provides a key out signal (Ring 2 
contact, shown at left). Key out goes low during 
transmit, and can be used for transmit/receive 
switching of linear amplifiers and transverters. For 
keyline voltage and current limits, see Specifications.  
  If the key out signal is not required, a regular stereo 
plug can used (3-circuit). This will short the key out 
signal to the sleeve (ground), but will not cause any 
damage or consume additional current. 
An Elecraft KX2 Accessory Cable (KX2ACBL) can 
be used to break out the computer control and key out 
signals separately. These can then be connected to both 
an Elecraft  KXPA100 ampflier via its supplied cable. 
Auxiliary Outputs (AUX) 
If the KX2 is fitted with a KXIO2 (pg. 33), then a 2.5 
mm AUX jack will be available. This jack provides 
two general-purpose outputs that can be programmed 
on a per-band basis to control equipment such as an 
antenna switch or transverter. On the connector, the 
sleeve is ground, tip is AUX 1, and ring is AUX 2. 
Program/Test (PGM) 
This jack is reserved for Elecraft factory test use.

Antennas 
General information on antennas can be found on the 
next page. Here, we show two examples of antennas 
for portable operation that can be set up quickly.  
The illustration below shows a simple wire antenna 
connected to a KX2 via a BNC-to-binding post adapter 
(Elecraft BNC-BP or equivelant). The wire tied to the 
red post (antenna hot lead) is attached to a tree or other 
tall support. The wire tied to the black post (radio 
chassis ground) is the equally important counterpoise, 
which is typically laid on the ground. 
A length of about 25 feet for each wire, matched to the 
KX2’s output using an antenna tuner (see ATU, pg. 11) 
will typically provide good performance on 40-10 m. 
(Without an ATU, resonant lengths are required for 
each band.) This antenna is ideal for outings where all 
gear must fit into a small bag (e.g, our model CS-40). 
 
At right, a KX2 is shown in hand-held orientation 
with a telescoping whip antenna. An Elecraft AX1,  
AX2, or similar whip can be used. 
(Such antennas are electrically short, making 
contacts more challenging. Best results will  
be obtained on 20 meters and higher.) 
When using a whip antenna, you’ll also need a 
counterpoise wire, shown here attached via  
a mini-banana plug (Elecraft model  
KX2GNDPLUG). A length of about  
13 feet is a good compromise for 30-10  
meters. This is sometimes called a 
 “trailing ground” by those who operate  
pedestrian mobile (/PM). If you step  
on the counterpoise wire, or get it  
snagged, the mini-banana plug 
will pull out safely, avoiding 
damage to the KX2.

General Antenna Information 
An antenna must be connected to the BNC jack via 
either coax or an adapter. If an antenna tuner is not 
used (an external tuner or an internal KXAT2), then a 
resonant antenna having a 50 ohm (approximate) load 
impedance on each band of operation is required. 
Examples can be found in the ARRL Antenna 
Handbook and other sources. A coax-fed inverted “V” 
or dipole can be very effective.  
SWR: One measure of how close an antenna is to 
resonance is its SWR (standing wave ratio). The KX2 
displays SWR when you use the TUNE switch (pg. 
19). An SWR of 1:1  (1.0-1 on the KX2’s display) is 
considered a “perfect” match. To ensure safe operation, 
the KX2 reduces power output if SWR is too high. 
Using An Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU):  An 
ATU will allow the KX2 to “see” a good match in 
many cases (i.e., a low SWR) even with non-resonant 
antennas. This allows the transmitter to deliver full 
power, and can improve receiver sensitivity. An ATU 
may allow one antenna to be used on multiple bands.  
You can use an external or internal ATU. The KXAT2 
(ATU option, pg. 33), stores matching data for each 
band; retuning takes less than 1 second. Data sets are 
provided for home/field use (MENU:ATU DATA). 
Antenna Wire: Insulated, stranded wire works well 
for portable antennas. We recommend #26 “Silky” 
from The Wireman (catalog #534). To avoid kinks, 
wire can be wound in a figure-8 pattern. For tossing 
wire into tree branches, attach a 1 to 2 oz. weight (such 
as stainless-steel hex nut) to the end of the wire. 
Feedline: When using low power, antennas can often 
be directly connected to the KX2 without any coax or 
other feedline. This is shown in both of the simple 
portable antennas on the previous page. However, 
balanced antennas such as dipoles and inverted Vs will 
function better when their feed point is physically well 
above ground.  
Resonant antennas (those which are cut to length for a 
given frequency) are typically fed with 50 ohm coax. 
RG-174 is a good choice when light weight is required. 
Random-length antennas can be fed with twin-lead, 
then connected to a balun (balanced-to-unbalanced 
converter), such as the Elecraft BL1 or BL2. The balun 
can then be connected directly to the transceiver (if an 
internal ATU is used) or to an external ATU. 
Ground and Counterpoise Systems: A ground or 
counterpoise is needed with many antennas. The ARRL 
Antenna Book provides examples. This is definitely 
needed when you use a whip, vertical, or random wire.  
The ground or counterpoise can be connected to the 
KX2 via the bottom cover thumb nuts or to the outer 
shield of the BNC jack. There’s also a hole in the left 
side panel, identified by a ground symbol, that is sized 
for a mini-banana plug. This is ideal for a quick-
disconnect trailing ground wire used during pedestrian 
mobile operation. See example on previous page. 
For improved performance, use at least one 1/4- 
wavelength radial for each band when possible. 
Adding more radials on a given band will further 
reduce losses, especially when transmitting.

Basic Operation 
This section describes basic KX2 features. Once 
you’ve mastered these, you’ll be ready to explore 
Advanced Operating Features (pg. 23) including 
built-in text decode, memories, and dual watch.  
 
Getting Started 
Before using the KX2, you’ll need to connect a power 
supply and an antenna. See Installation (pg. 5). 
Turning the KX2 On/Off 
To turn the KX2 on or off, press and hold the RATE 
and A/B switches simultaneously for about two 
seconds, then release. The switches are identified by an 
“ON” label below the large knob (VFO A). This dual-
switch power on/off method reduces the likelihood of 
accidental power-on in a backpack or carrying case. 
  Always turn the KX2 off as described above 
before turning off or disconnecting the power 
source. This will ensure that settings are saved. 
Switch  TAP  and  HOLD  Functions 
All KX2 switches have two functions: 
§ 
Tap to activate the function labeled on a switch, 
e.g. RATE  
§ 
Hold for about 0.5 second to activate the function 
labeled below a switch, e.g. FREQ 
AF Gain and other Knob Functions 
Each small knob has two primary functions. For 
example, 
 AF/MON  normally controls receiver AF 
gain. The setting is displayed in the VFO B area during 
knob rotation. Tapping this knob briefly switches to 
the MON function (sidetone or voice monitor level). 
Holding the knob—pushing it for over 0.5 seconds—
switches to its secondary function,  
 NB  (pg. 18).  
Knobs may also be used in conjunction with nearby 
switches. For example, if you tap DISP, rotating          
 OFS/B selects special VFO B displays (pg. 23). 
Using the Configuration Menu 
To access the menu, hold  MENU until the          
BKLIGHT (LCD brightness) menu entry appears in the 
VFO B area. The setting appears in the VFO A area.  
To change a setting, rotate VFO A (large knob). In the 
case of BKLIGHT, this selects backlight ON or OFF. 
To scroll through menu entries, use the small knob 
above the menu switch, 
 OFS/B.  To exit the menu, 
tap DISP. 
  While in the menu, holding  MENU  for ~3 seconds 
displays information about the current menu entry. 
Configuration and Calibration Functions 
Once you’ve mastered the menu, you should review 
your KX2’s Configuration settings (pg. 36). The 
menu is also used for factory Calibration (pg.38).

Band Selection 
The KX2 transmits and receives in the 80-10 m 
amateur bands. It also provides general coverage 
receive from 0.5 to 32 MHz, which includes the AM 
broadcast band and 160 m.. (Sensitivity and image 
rejection are reduced below 3 MHz; see 
Specifications, pg. 69.)  
Characteristics of each amateur band are briefly 
summarized below. For further information, see the 
ARRL band plan (www.arrl.org/band-plan-1). 
To change bands: Tap BAND, rotate the VFO A knob 
to select the desired band, then tap any switch to exit. 
You can also change bands using direct frequency

Direct Frequency Entry 
A subset of the controls functions as a numeric keypad 
for use with FREQ. See white secondary switch and 
knob labels  0 - 9,  decimal point, and enter (
). 
First, hold  FREQ . Then enter one or two MHz digits, 
optionally followed by a decimal point and up to three 
kHz digits. Next tap    
 .  (BAND) to accept, or any 
other switch to cancel. Examples: 
14.255 MHz:   FREQ    1 4  .  2  5  5    .
. .  
7.000 MHz:     FREQ    7     
 .  
Mode Selection 
Tap MODE  to select SSB, CW, AM, or FM mode. 
Tap DATA to select data mode (pg. 15). To select 
alternate modes (USB/LSB, CW normal/reverse, or 
DATA normal/ reverse) use the ALT MD menu entry. 
SSB (pg. 20) is either LSB (lower sideband) or USB 
(upper). LSB is used on 160/80/40 m; others use USB. 
CW mode (pg. 21) uses much less bandwidth than 
SSB. Its high signal-to-noise ratio is ideal for QRP. 
AM mode (pg. 22) has a characteristic “warm” tone. It 
can be used for listening to broadcast stations. 
FM mode (pg. 22) is used on 10 m or with transverters. 
DATA modes (pg. 27) are often used with a computer 
connected to the KX2 to send/receive text. However, 
there are also three built-in data modes that use the 
KX2’s display for received text, and a keyer paddle for 
transmit, converting the CW you send into data.  

============================================================

VFO A and B 
The KX2 provides two VFOs (see glossary, pg. 67). 
Each VFO has its own frequency, mode, and filter 
settings. Use of VFO B  (
 OFS/B) is optional.  
VFO A normally controls both the receive and 
transmit frequency. If you use VFO A to tune in a 
signal clearly, you’ll also be on-frequency for transmit. 
VFO B can serve as a holding register for a frequency 
of interest (see A / B swap below). It is also used with 
SPLIT (pg. 30) and Dual Watch (pg. 25). To tune 
VFO B, first make sure the B LED above the knob is 
lit. If not, tap the 
 OFS/B knob.  
Tuning rates: Tapping  RATE normally alternates 
between 10 Hz and coarse-tuning steps (MENU:VFO 
CRS). The default coarse step size for CW is 0.1 kHz, 
and for SSB, 0.5 kHz. In DATA modes, or when the 
audio peaking filter is in use in CW mode (APF, pg. 
18), RATE alternates between 1 Hz and 10 Hz steps.  
    
 OFS/B  is used to tune VFO A in coarse steps. 
For this purpose, the OFS LED must be lit (if not, tap 
the knob), and RIT (see at right) must be turned off.  
To lock VFO A: Hold FREQ for about 3 seconds. Tap 
RATE to unlock. To lock VFO B, first swap it with 
VFO A, lock A, then swap again. 
To copy VFO A’s frequency to VFO B: Hold              
A > B. Tap twice to copy mode and filter settings as 
well. 
VFO A and B swap: Tap  A / B to exchange VFO 
frequencies, modes, and all other settings.  
Incremental Tuning (RIT and XIT) 
RIT, or receive incremental tuning, adjusts the receive 
frequency without affecting your transmit frequency. 
RIT is sometimes called a clarifier since it can be used 
to tune in voice signals clearly. It is also useful in CW 
and DATA modes when a station calls off-frequency. 
XIT, or transmit incremental tuning, adjusts the 
transmit frequency without affecting the receive 
frequency. (An alternative is to use SPLIT, pg. 30.) 
∆ F (Delta-F) LED 
:  This LED turns on whenever 
RIT, XIT, or SPLIT is in use as a reminder that your 
receive and transmit frequencies may be different. 
To use RIT: First, tap  RIT . This turns on the RIT 
icon and the OFS LED. Adust using 
 OFS/B . 
To use XIT: XIT is controlled using MENU:XIT. 
Setting the menu entry to ON turns on the XIT icon 
and the OFS LED. Adjust using 
 OFS/B . 
To zero the RIT/XIT offset: Hold CLR. 
  You can still use the  
 OFS/B  control to tune 
VFO B, even if RIT or XIT is turned on. Just tap the 
knob to turn the B LED back on. The RIT/XIT icons 
on the LCD will retain their current states. 
Special VFO B Displays 
To see special information on VFO B, tap  DISP , then 
rotate 
 OFS/B. Available displays include time, 
supply voltage, supply current, amp hours used, logged 
text review, etc. (see pg. 23).

Receive Settings 
The Receive controls group, which includes the           
 AF/MON knob and the two switches below it, is 
used to set up the KX2’s receiver. On the display, 
directly above these controls, is the filter passband 
graphic. This shows the receiver’s audio passband. 
AF Gain / Monitor Level Control 
The 
 AF/MON knob normally controls receiver AF 
gain. Tapping the knob switches its function to MON 
(monitor volume level). In CW mode, this turns on the 
sidetone (also see Spot, pg. 21). In SSB mode, you’ll 
hear your microphone audio (pg. 17). 
  Switch activation tones, if used, have the same 
volume level as the CW sidetone (as set in CW mode 
using 
 MON ). Switch tones can be set to off, on, or 
Morse code characters (MENU:SW TONE). 
Preamp and Attenuator 
On successive taps, PRE cycles through preamp on 
(attenuator off), both off, and attenuator on (preamp 
off). PRE and ATTN icons are updated accordingly. 
Typically the preamp is used on the higher bands or 
with low-gain antennas. If interference is heavy, turn 
the preamp off, and if necessary, turn the attenuator on.  
  You can improve sensivitity by using the internal 
ATU to resonate the antenna. Tap ATU.  
  The KX2 will automatically reduce receive gain in 
the presence of very strong signals. The overload icon 
(RX) will turn on. Also see MENU:COR LVL. 
Filter Passband / Squelch Control  
In FM mode, tapping FIL  temporarily assigns the      
 AF/MON  knob to squelch. In all other modes, 
tapping FIL places the KX2 in FIL ADJ mode. The  
 AF/MON  and  
 KYR/MIC  knobs can then be 
used to adjust the filter passband per-mode as 
described below.                   
The passband graphic shows the width and centering of 
the current filter. The example below shows a medium-
width filter that is centered (not shifted):  
 
In general, a narrow passband reduces interference 
(QRM) and noise (QRN), while a wider passband can 
reduce listening fatigue and improve fidelity. 
Using FIL ADJ mode: 
• 
Rotate 
 AF/MON  knob to adjust the filter width.  
• 
Tap  
 AF/MON  to normalize the filter to the 
standard per-mode setting. This turns on the two 
“wings” shown at the left and right ends of the 
graphic as shown above. 
• 
Rotate  
 KYR/MIC  to shift the passband left or 
right. 
• 
Tap  
 KYR/MIC  to center the filter without 
changing the bandwidth. 
• 
To exit FIL ADJ mode, tap any other switch, key 
the transmitter, or rotate VFO A. 
  Filters in the KX2 are implemented entirely within 
the digital signal processor (DSP).

Noise Reduction 
Noise reduction (NR) removes random background 
noise (hiss or static). It has a characteristic “hollow” 
sound. Higher settings may attenuate weak signals. 
Holding NR turns on noise reduction and displays its 
setting, which can then be adjusted using the knob 
above the switch. Tap any switch to exit the setting 
display. Hold NR again to turn noise reduction off. 
Noise Blanking 
Noise blanking can eliminate repetitive noise such as 
that from power lines, appliances, and vehicle ignition 
systems. Use the lowest effective setting. 
Holding NB (a function of the 
 AF/MON knob) turns 
on the noise blanker. The setting can then be adjusted 
using this knob. Tap any switch to exit the setting 
display. Hold NB again to turn the blanker off. 
Audio Peaking Filter (APF) and Notch Filter 
In CW mode, holding APF-AN turns on a very narrow 
filter to improve copy of weak CW signals right at the 
receiver’s noise floor. The filter graphic changes as 
shown below, and VFO tuning is set to 1 Hz. 
 
 
In SSB and AM modes, APF-AN turns on auto-notch 
(AN). Auto-notch can suppress one or more audible 
carriers (continuous tones) automatically, while having 
little impact on speech signals. 
CW/DATA Tuning Aid (CWT) 
Accurate tuning of received signals is required before 
you call a station, or when you’re using built-in text 
decode (TEXT, pg. 21). Signals can always be tuned in 
by ear, but the KX2 also provides a visual tuning aid 
(CWT). With CWT on (MENU:CWT), the upper half 
of the S-meter changes as shown below.  
    CW and PSK31/PSK63                          RTTY 
    
        
 
A CW signal appears as a single bar. Tune the signal 
until the bar is centered beneath “CWT” as shown. 
This single-bar display also applies to PSK-D (pg. 28).  
In RTTY or radioteletype modes, mark and space tones 
appear as bars on either side of the CWT pointer (see 
FSK D and AFSK A data modes, pg. 28). With no 
signal, you’ll see a “ghosting” effect (above). As you 
tune in a signal, solid bars will appear on both sides. 
To optimize CW/data text decode, you may need to 
fine-tune the VFO position. This is especially true in 
PSK-D mode. Use 1 Hz steps (RATE).  
Spot and Auto-Spot:  Tapping 
 KYR-SPT/MIC 
generates an audible spot tone in CW, PSK-D, and 
FSK-D modes. Tune the VFO until the signal pitch 
matches the spot tone. If CWT (see above) is turned on 
in CW and PSK-D modes, tapping this knob will tune 
in the signal automatically, if possible (auto-spot).

Transmit Settings 
The Transmit controls group (to the left of the VFO A 
knob) is used to set up the KX2’s transmitter.  
  This section provides an overview of transmit 
controls. Detailed per-mode instructions follow. 
Keyer Speed-Spot/Mic Gain and Power Output 
In CW mode,  
 KYR-SPT/MIC  sets the keyer speed 
(in WPM). Tapping the knob spots a signal (pg. 21). In 
voice modes, this knob sets mic gain. A typical seting 
is 15-25 for use with the Elecraft MH3 microphone. 
Holding this knob in for ~0.5 seconds selects  
 PWR  
(power output control). Power level is shown on the 
RF bar graph during transmit. PWR can be set as high 
as 15 W on 80-20 m and 12 W on 15-10 m, but see 
Specifications and notes below. A supply voltage of 
12 V or higher is required for SSB use at full power. 
If a KXPA100 amplifier is connected, power can be 
set up to 100 W (see KXPA100 owner’s manual). 
  The right side of the KX2 may become hot 
during transmit in high-duty-cycle modes. If the PA 
temperature is too high, power will be automatically 
reduced. Third-party add-on heatsinks are available. 
  Maximum power output varies with supply 
voltage and other factors. If output is lower than 
expected, use the special VFO B displays (pg. 23) to 
check supply voltage, current drain, and PA 
temperature. The selected parameter will be shown on 
VFO B during TUNE. (SWR is shown on VFO A.)  
Transmit Controls and ATU Tuning 
Tap  
 AF/MON  to set the transmit monitor volume 
(speech in voice modes, sidetone in CW mode).  
XMIT switches from receive to transmit. However, in 
CW modes, MENU:VOX MD is usually set to ON, so 
you can simply hit the key or keyer paddle to transmit. 
(VOX is always on in PSK-D/FSK-D modes.) In voice 
modes, tapping XMIT is an alternative to using mic 
PTT or VOX. (See pg. 20 for SSB VOX setup.) 
TUNE is used to transmit a CW signal at the power 
level selected by the  
 PWR control. This is useful 
with external wattmeters and antenna tuners. The    
TUN PWR menu entry can be used to override the 
PWR control setting and transmit at a lower level. 
ATU starts automatic antenna matching if a KXAT2 
internal ATU is installed (pg. 19), or if a KXPA100 
amp with KXAT100 ATU is connected (pg. 33). 
MENU:ATU MD must be set to AUTO. Matching 
takes an average of 4 seconds, initially. Settings are 
recalled on band change, or when you transmit after 
moving the VFO a significant distance. The ATU icon 
flashes briefly when settings are recalled. In CW mode, 
recall is delayed until a pause in keying. Also see 
MENU:ATU DATA for selection of ATU data sets. 
  With difficult loads, try tapping ATU a second 
time within 5 seconds to search for a lower SWR. 
PFn (programmable functions): See pg. 25. 
MSG and REC are used to play and record CW, data, 
or digital voice messages (pgs. 22 and 30). 

============================================================

SSB Mode  
Use the steps below to do initial SSB setup:  
§ 
Set 
 PWR to 0.0 W. 
§ 
Tap MODE to select SSB (either LSB or USB). 
To change SSB modes, use MENU:ALT MD. 
§ 
Tap 
 AF/MON  to set the voice monitor level. 
Start with 3. High settings may sound distorted. 
§ 
Set MENU:TX CMP (speech compression) to 0 
initially. Exit the menu. 
§ 
Tap XMIT or hold in the mic’s PTT switch. Note: 
Hand-held mics like the Elecraft MH3 should 
nearly touch your mouth when you are speaking.  
§ 
While speaking into the mic, adjust mic gain           
(
 MIC). This will turn on the transmit CMP and 
ALC bar graphs. While speaking, adjust mic gain 
for about 5 ALC bars (see below). Mic gain for 
the Elecraft MH3 is typically set to 15-25, and 
30-40 for the internal mic. 
 
§ 
To use speech compression, set MENU:TX CMP 
to 10-20 initially. Compression increases average 
“talk power” with only slightly decreased fidelity. 
§ 
Exit transmit mode. Set  
 PWR to the desired 
level. Do not use MIC gain to set power level. 
Set mic gain to a fixed level as described above. 
VOX Setup 
Several menu entries are used to configure SSB VOX 
(voice-operated transmit):  
If MENU:VOX MD is OFF (PTT, or push-to-talk 
mode), the transmitter must be enabled by tapping 
XMIT or by holding the mic’s PTT button. With VOX 
on, the VOX icon turns on, and transmit starts by 
speaking. If VOX is on, the remaining menu entries 
below should also be set up. 
  VOX cannot be used with the built-in 
microphone. Use the XMIT switch to transmit. 
MENU:VOX GN  (VOX gain) should be set to trigger 
at normal speech level, but not in response to 
incidental noise. Start with low settings (10-20). 
MENU:VOX DLY sets the VOX (voice-operated 
transmit) delay time in seconds. A setting of about 0.5 
seconds will keep the radio in transmit mode during 
typical continuous speech.  
MENU:VOX INH (VOX inhibit, or anti-vox) can 
prevent speaker audio from triggering VOX.  
Transmit Metering  
In voice modes, tapping  
 MIC switches the transmit 
bar graph from  SWR / RF to CMP / ALC. 
The CMP / ALC scale is selected automatically when 
you adjust mic gain or speech compression. The      
SWR / RF scale is restored after a few seconds. 

============================================================

CW Mode 
Basic CW-Mode Setup 
§ 
Tap MODE to select CW (normal CW mode). 
Some operators prefer to use CW reverse  (CW 
REV). See MENU:ALT MD for details. 
§ 
MENU:VOX MD can be set to ON (VOX) or OFF 
(PTT) for CW mode. Most operators use VOX, 
allowing the transmitter to be keyed immediately 
whenever a hand key or keyer paddle is used. PTT 
requires manual transmit start/stop using XMIT.  
§ 
Set sidetone pitch using MENU:PITCH. 500-700 
Hz is typically used with headphones. 
§ 
Set sidetone volume using 
 MON. 
§ 
MENU:VOX DLY sets the break-in or QSK delay 
(the time before the receiver recovers after key-
up). A setting of 0.00 provides full break-in, also 
known as “full QSK.” (The QSK icon will appear.) 
MENU:CW WGHT provides two variations on 
QSK; CW operators may wish to try both.  
CW Receive Filtering 
As conditions change, you can adjust the filter 
passband using FIL as described on pg. 17. A narrow 
passband can improve copy in the presence of noise or 
interference, while a wider passband can be less 
fatiguing to listen to. You’ll also find the audio 
peaking filter (APF, pg. 18) to be very useful with 
weak CW signals.  
 
Off-Air Code Practice 
Sending CW normally produces both a sidetone and a 
transmitted signal. If PTT-CW is selected (by setting 
MENU:VOX MD to OFF), hitting the key without 
first tapping XMIT will generate only a sidetone. This 
is useful for code practice or keyer speed adjustment.  
CW-Mode Menu Settings 
You can use the menu to change the settings for iambic 
keying (CW IAMB), keying weight (CW WGHT), and 
paddle normal/reverse or hand key (CW KEY1 for the 
KEY jack, and CW KEY2 for an attached KXPD2 or 
KXPD3 keyer paddle).  
CWT, SPOT and Auto-Spot 
When calling a station, you should try to match your 
frequency to theirs. To facilitate this, the KX2 provides 
both a visual tuning aid (CWT), as well as manual and 
automatic spotting in CW and some data modes. See 
pg. 18. 
CW Text Decode/Display 
The KX2 can decode transmitted and received CW 
signals, displaying the text on VFO B (pg. 29). This is 
especially useful when you’re learning CW, or if 
someone who doesn’t know CW is looking over your 
shoulder while you make CW QSOs. It’s also 
indispensable for CW-to-DATA operation (pg. 27).  
The KX2 can also capture transmitted CW for logging 
purposes. See MENU:LOGGING. 

============================================================
PAGE 22
============================================================

22 
CW/DATA Message Record/Play 
There are 3 text messages, each having up to 250 
characters. These apply to CW as well as DATA 
modes FSK D and PSK D.  
  Messages can only be recorded using the KX2’s 
built-in keyer function (using either an external keyer 
paddle, KXPD2, or KXPD3). An external keyer cannot 
be used. Messages can also be viewed or edited using 
the KX2 Utility computer application. 
Message Record: To start recording, hold REC , then 
select a message by tapping any of switches 1 through 
3 of the numeric keypad (the PRE, FIL, and ATU 
switches, respectively). The remaining text space will 
be displayed as you send. Tap MSG to finish 
recording.  
Message Play: To play, tap MSG , then select a 
message (1 through 3). To cancel, tap XMIT  or hit the 
keyer paddle or hand key. 
Message Erase: Hold REC, select a message (1 
through 3), then hold CLR. 
Auto-Repeat: To auto-repeat a message, tap MSG , 
but then hold rather than tap a message switch (1 
through 3).  MENU:MSG RPT sets the message 
repeat interval (1 to 255 seconds). To cancel auto-
repeat, tap XMIT  or hit the keyer paddle or hand key. 
Chaining: Tapping a message switch during playback 
chains another message onto the message being played. 
Holding a message switch during playback chains a 
repeating message. 
AM Mode 
To select AM, tap the MODE switch. AM mode can be 
enabled/disabled using MENU:AM MODE. 
AM Receive: AM mode can provide a “warmer” 
sound that SSB mode when used to copy shortwave 
broadcast stations. MENU:VFO CRS provides coarse-
tuning selections of 1, 5, 9 and 10 kHz for AM mode. 
Look for AM amateur signals around 3.870 MHz. 
AM Transmit:  Setup for AM transmit is the same as 
for SSB (pg. 20). However, speech compression should 
be turned off for AM mode (MENU:TX CMP). The 
RF bar graph will indicate about 1/3 to 1/2 the power 
set by the power control. AM is far less power-efficient 
than SSB, so at QRP levels, SSB is preferred. 
FM Mode 
To select FM, tap the MODE switch. This mode can be 
enabled/disabled using MENU:FM MODE. 
FM and Repeater Configuration:  Use MENU:FM 
DEV  to set deviation. (To adjust PL tone deviation, 
tap 1  while in this menu entry.) MENU:RPT OFS  is 
used to specify repeater offsets. In the MENU:FM 
TONE  menu entry, tap 1 to turn PL tone encode on or 
off, and rotate VFO A to the select tone pitch. Tones 
and offsets are stored in frequency memories. 
FM Operation:  To adjust squelch level, tap FIL, then 
rotate  
 AF/MON . Hold SPLIT  to select  + / - / 
SIMPLEX. “+” and “-” appear under the “FM” icon. 
Also see Channel Hopping (pg. 24).

Advanced Operating Features 
Special VFO B Displays 
The KX2 can display time of day and other parameters 
on the VFO B display. To access these displays, tap  
DISP , then rotate the 
 OFS/B control.  
The following special displays are available: 
§ 
24-hour time, obtained from the real-time-clock 
on the KXIO2 or KXIBC2 module. If neither is not 
installed, the time since last power-on will be 
displayed. Set the time using MENU:TIME.  
§ 
Power supply voltage. If both an internal battery 
and external power source are connected to the 
KX2, this display shows the higher of the two. The 
voltage remains displayed even when using TUNE, 
so you can check key-down conditions. 
§ 
Battery Voltage. This display is only available if 
MENU:KXIBC2 is set to NOR; refer to the 
KXIBC manual. Display persists during TUNE. 
§ 
Supply current. Typical RX current is 0.15-0.18 
A; TX, 1 to 3 A. Display persists during TUNE. 
§ 
Power Amplifier (PA) temperature. The KX2’s 
internal PA temperature is shown as PA.I nnC  
(Internal). If a KXPA100 is connected via the 
remote-control cable, MENU:PA MODE is ON, 
and 
 PWR  is set to > 10 W, the KXPA100’s PA 
temperature is shown, as PA.X nnC (eXternal). 
PA temperatures rise gradually as you transmit. 
Display persists during TUNE. 
§ 
Audio Signal level (AFV). Shows the KX2’s 
audio output level, prior to the AF gain control 
(the AF gain control has no effect on this reading). 
The reading will vary with preamp and attenuator 
settings. AFV is used along with dBV (below). 
§ 
Relative audio signal (dBV). Used to measure 
receiver sensitivity or or to compare signals. First 
select AFV (described above) and allow the 
voltage reading to stabilize. (This may not be 
possible with rapidly changing signals.) Once the 
signal appears stable, select dBV. You should now 
see a reading of around 0 dBV (see Glossary) 
relative to the last AFV reading. If you change the 
setting of the preamp or attenuator, you should see 
this reading change. However, it may not change 
as much as you expect unless you also turn AGC 
off using the AGC menu entry. (Be sure to turn 
AF gain down before turning AGC off, as the 
signal may become very loud.) 
§ 
Amp hours:  Shows total amp hours used since 
the value was last reset (for details, see  
MENU:AMP HRS). Used to test batteries or 
estimate remaining battery charge.  
  Hold  CLR  while in the AMP HRS menu 
entry to zero the amp hours value. 
§ 
Log Data:  Use VFO A to scroll through recorded

Frequency Memories 
The KX2 has 100 general-purpose frequency memories 
(00-99), plus four quick memories on each band. Each 
memory stores VFOs, modes, and other settings. Quick 
memories provide an easy way to get to segments used 
for each operating mode. For example, you could use 
quick-memory 1 as an SSB starting point, use 2 for 
CW, 3 for data, etc. Memories can be set up manually 
or with the Elecraft Frequency Memory Editor (pg. 35).  
To store a general-purpose memory (00-99): First 
hold  STORE , then locate the desired memory by 
rotating the VFO A knob. The VFO A frequencies 
presently stored in each memory will be shown. When 
you reach the desired memory number, hold STORE 
again to exit, or tap any other switch to cancel. 
To recall a general-purpose memory: Hold 
RCL/SCN , then select a memory using VFO A. Tap 
any switch to exit.  
To store a per-band quick memory: Hold STORE, 
then tap the target quick memory (1 - 4).   
To recall a per-band quick memory: Hold 
RCL/SCN , then tap the target quick memory (1 - 4).   
To erase a general-purpose memory: While scrolling 
through memories to store or recall, hold CLR.  
To add a text label to a general-purpose memory: 
First hold RCL/SCN , then select a memory (00-99) 
using VFO A. Next, rotate VFO B to select each text 
label position in turn as indicated by the flashing 
cursor. Use VFO A to select label characters (A-Z, 0-9, 
and symbols). Hold STORE to exit.  
Scanning  
Scanning tunes a band segment continuously until a 
modulated signal is found. To use scanning: 
§ 
Set VFO A and B to the desired scan start/end 
frequencies, and VFO A to the desired mode. 
STORE in memory 00-99 as described at left. 
§ 
To start scanning, first recall a general-purpose 
frequency memory as described at left. Then hold 
RCL/SCN until SCAN appears on VFO B (~3 s). 
§ 
To stop scanning, rotate VFO A or tap any switch. 
To restart, hold RCL/SCN for about 3 seconds. 
Channel Hopping 
Scanning (or manually tuning) among a group of 
memories is referred to as channel hopping. This is 
especially useful on 60 m, or with repeaters. Memories 
in a group must all be in the same band. 
To set up channel hopping: 
§ 
Set up VFO A for the first target frequency and 
mode. STORE this setup in a memory (00-99).  
§ 
Set up and STORE the remaining frequencies in 
the next successive numbered memories. 
§ 
Add a text label to each memory in the group, 
using an asterisk (*) as the first character. 
§ 
To start manual channel hopping, recall one of the 
memories in the target group. VFO A will now hop 
among the grouped memories. Holding RCL/SCN 
for ~3 seconds starts scanning within the group. 
§ 
To disable channel hopping, tap RATE.

Audio Effects 
Stereo headphones or dual external speakers can be 
used with the KX2’s DSP audio effects (AFX). At 
present the KX2 provides one audio effects mode, 
DELAY, which creates an illusion of acoustic “space,” 
resulting in a less-fatiguing sound and in some cases 
better copy of weak signals. MENU:AFX MD is used 
to select the desired AFX setting. 
 
Dual Watch 
Dual watch allows you to listen on both the VFO A 
and VFO B frequencies, as if you had two receivers. 
You’ll hear the signal at VFO A in the left channel, 
and the signal at VFO B on the right. 
  Stereo headphones or dual external speakers 
are required to use dual watch.  
Dual watch has various uses. For example, you might 
be waiting for a station on VFO B’s frequency to 
complete a QSO, while using VFO A to look for other 
stations. You can tap A / B to alternate between the 
two frequencies. 
Dual watch is also ideal for working DX stations that 
are listening at an offset from their transmit frequency. 
You can listen to the DX station on VFO B, while 
using VFO A to find the station they’re presently 
working. Once that station has been found, you may 
want to move up or down slightly to find a clear spot in 
which to call. 
To turn on dual watch:  Set MENU:DUAL RX to 
AUTO. This turns on the SUB (“sub receiver”) icon. 
If you turn dual watch on/off frequently, you may wish 
to access it via PFn (described below). 
Dual Watch Limitations:   
§ 
VFO B can be up to 7 kHz above VFO A, or up to 
23 kHz below VFO A. If you exceed this 
separation with DUAL RX turned on, the SUB 
icon flashes slowly as a reminder. This doesn’t 
prevent you from exceeding the separation, but it 
does disable dual watch until VFO B is back in 
range.  
§ 
Dual watch overrides the normal audio effects 
mode (AFX MD).  
§ 
Headphones or external speakers must be used. 
Programmable Function Switch (PFn) 
You can access up to four often-used menu entries 
quickly by assigning them to programmable functions 
PF1-PF4. This is done using the PFn switch. 
To set up a programmable function: 
§ 
Hold MENU, then rotate VFO B to find the target 
menu entry.  
§ 
Hold PFn , then tap 1 through 4 to assign PF1-
PF4 to this menu entry. You’ll see PFn SET. 
§ 
Exit the menu. 
  If a parameter has only two values, accessing it 
with PFn will change the value and exit the menu.

Receive Audio Equalization (RX EQ) 
The KX2 provides 8 bands of receive audio 
equalization via the RX EQ menu entry. RX EQ can 
compensate for physical acoustics (of the room, 
headphones, internal speaker, external speaker), 
tailoring the audio to your personal preference.  
Two receive EQ setups are provided: one for CW 
mode, and the other for voice modes. RX EQ does not 
apply to DATA modes.  
In the RX EQ menu entry, the VFO A display shows 8 
individual vertical bar graphs. The example below 
shows various amounts of EQ for each band.  
 
 
The center frequencies of the 8 audio EQ bands are 50, 
100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 2400, and 3200 Hz. To select 
a band to change, tap 0-7 on the keypad. For example, 
tapping 0 selects the 50-Hz band.  
Next, rotate VFO A to specify boost or cut (+/- 16 dB). 
The illustration above shows the 800 Hz EQ band 
(0.80 kHz) being set to +1 dB of boost. You can hold  
CLR to reset all of the RX EQ bands to 0 dB (no cut or 
boost). 
 
Transmit Audio Equalization (TX EQ) 
  Most microphones, including the Elecraft MH3 
and the KX2’s built-in mic, will provide good audio 
quality with default (flat) TX EQ. Also, excessively 
high TX EQ settings can cause distortion. 
If required, transmit audio equalization can compensate 
for microphone and voice variations. MENU:TX EQ  
works exactly the same as RX EQ (described at left) 
and can be adjusted during transmit. TX EQ is not 
applicable to CW or DATA modes. 
While adjusting TX EQ, monitor your voice using 
headphones (use 
 MON to set the level), or listen to 
your transmitted signal on another receiver. If you hear 
distortion, reset all TX EQ bands using CLR. You may 
also have excessive mic gain or compression. 
 
SSB/CW VFO Offset 
The KX2 can automatically offset the VFO frequency 
when you switch from SSB to CW mode, so other 
stations will hear the correct CW pitch. See 
MENU:CW WGHT for details.

Data Modes 
The KX2 supports data operation via a computer and 
special software. But it can also be used in RTTY and 
PSK31/PSK63 modes without a computer, thanks to 
the built-in FSK D and PSK D modes.  
  5.0 watts or lower is recommended in all data 
modes. The KX2 will reduce power, if necessary, to 
maintain a safe operating temperature.  
  Mic gain, RX/TX EQ, and TX CMP are not 
applicable to FSK D and PSK D modes. 
FSK D Mode (RTTY) 
FSK D (RTTY1) is the easiest data mode to use: 
§ 
Tap DATA to select data modes. 
§ 
Tap DATA again and rotate 
 OFS/B  to select 
the FSK D sub-mode. Tap the switch again to exit 
the sub-mode display. A dual-passband 
(mark/space) filter will appear: 
                       
 
§ 
Hold TEXT to turn on text decode. 
§ 
The sideband can be reversed (MENU:ALT MD). 
§ 
Optionally turn on the tuning aid (CWT, pg. 21). 
                                                      
1 FSK stands for frequency-shift keying, used with RTTY 
(radioteletype). The KX2 uses a 170 Hz shift. RTTY signals 
You’ll now be able to copy RTTY signals. If you see 
only numbers and punctuation, try tapping DATA 
twice to restore “letters” mode. 
RTTY stations can most often be found on 20 m, from 
14080-14090 kHz. Other popular “watering holes” 
include 80 m (3570-3600), 40 m (~7040 and ~7080), 
17 m (~18100), and 15 m (~21080). During contests, 
stations spread out over a much wider range. 
To transmit in FSK D mode (CW-to-Data):  Plug a 
keyer paddle into the KEY jack, or attach a KXPD2 (or 
KXPD3) paddle at the front of the KX2. (See the CW 
KEY1 and CW KEY2 menu entries.) When you send 
CW, the KX2 will convert it to RTTY. (You’ll hear the 
CW sidetone as well as weak RTTY tones.)  
You can use CW message memories in FSK D mode, 
as well as with KX2 Utility’s Terminal function (pg. 
35). FSK-D mode transmit text can also be captured 
for logging purposes (see MENU:LOGGING). 
  You cannot use a hand key for FSK D transmit. 
  The KX2 adds a 4-second “idle time” (giving you 
time to decide what to say next) each time you stop 
sending. At the end of this period, the receiver is re-
enabled. To terminate the idle period quickly, send 
the character  . . - -  in CW. This “IM” prosign can 
also be inserted at the end of a message. It will not be 
transmitted on the air, but you’ll hear it in your CW 
sidetone. 
are encoded using a 5-level code called baudot, at a baud 
rate of 45 baud, or about 60 words per minute. 

============================================================
PAGE 28
============================================================

28 
PSK D Mode (PSK31/PSK63) 
PSK D is the KX2’s built-in version of PSK31 (or 
PSK63)2, which is highly reliable at low power levels. 
To use PSK D mode: 
§ 
Tap DATA to select data modes. 
§ 
Tap DATA again and rotate 
 OFS/B  to select 
the PSK D sub-mode. Use VFO A to select 31 or 
63 baud. Tap DATA again to exit. A narrow 
receive passband will be selected. 
§ 
Hold TEXT to turn on text decode. (Also see 
MENU:LOGGING for PSK-D text capture.) 
§ 
The sideband can be reversed (MENU:ALT MD). 
§ 
Optionally turn on the tuning aid (CWT, pg. 21). 
Before attempting to transmit in this mode, you should 
practice tuning in signals. Try listening to 14070-
14073 kHz (20 m), tuning signals in 1 Hz steps until 
the decode appears accurate.  
  A PSK signal can sometimes be tuned in at 
multiple VFO frequencies, separated by ~8-16 Hz. To 
ensure you’re listening on the correct frequency before 
you transmit, use auto-spot (pg. 21). 
For PSK D transmit, a keyer paddle directly conntected 
to the KX2 is required. Use the “IM” prosign to 
terminate transmit quickly. (See previous page.) 
                                                      
2 PSK stands for phase-shift keying. 31 and 63 refer to the 
baud rates, 31.25 or 62.5 baud. PSK signals are encoded 
using a very efficient representation called varicode. 
 Audio Data Modes (DATA A and AFSK A) 
A computer, sound card, and appropriate software can 
be used with the KX2 for data communications. Many 
different modes can be used in this way, including 
PSK31/63, RTTY, JT65, Pactor, Olivia, MFSK, SSTV, 
etc. The KX2 provides DATA A mode for this 
purpose. DATA A automatically disables compression 
and RX/TX EQ. Upper sideband is the default. 
For audio-based RTTY, you can also use AFSK A 
mode. Like FSK D, AFSK A provides a dual-passband 
RTTY filter and text decode. The VFO is tuned to the 
mark frequency. Lower sideband is the default. 
To use audio data modes: 
§ 
Tap DATA twice; rotate 
 OFS/B  to select 
DATA A or AFSK A. Tap DATA to exit. 
§ 
In AFSK A mode, optionally hold TEXT to turn 
on text decode. Also see CWT (pg. 21). 
§ 
Connect your computer’s line-audio output to the 
MIC jack. Connect the KX2’s PHONES jack to 
your computer’s line-audio input. Shielded cables 
should be used. You may need an attenuator if the 
drive levels are too high. 
§ 
Refer to your data communications software 
manual to determine how to set up the KX2’s VFO 
for accurate frequency display.  
§ 
VOX can be used for data; see MENU:VOX MD. 

============================================================
PAGE 29
============================================================

29 
§ 
While transmitting audio data, adjust MIC gain for 
no more than 4 to 5 bars of ALC indication. 
§ 
RX/TX EQ and TX CMP are not applicable to 
DATA A and AFSK A modes. 
Text Decode And Display 
The KX2 can decode CW, PSK31 or PSK63 (PSK D) 
and RTTY (FSK D). CW speeds from about 8 to 70 
WPM can be decoded. Decoded text is displayed on 
VFO B. If no signal is tuned in, random characters may 
be displayed. 
To set up text decode: 
§ 
Select the desired mode (CW, FSK D, or  PSK D) 
using MODE or DATA.  
§ 
If a special VFO B display mode is in effect, 
cancel it by tapping DISP. 
§ 
You’ll probably want to turn on CWT as a tuning 
aid (pg. 21). Also, auto-spot (pg. 21) can be used to 
automatically tune in signals. 
§ 
Hold TEXT .  In DATA modes, this will alternate 
between DEC ON and DEC OFF. (The T mode 
icon appears when it is on). In CW mode, use       
 OFS/B  to select a text decode mode. TX 
ONLY displays only CW characters you send 
using the internal keyer. To decode text from on-
air CW signals, use one of the RX THRn  
settings. Turn CWT on and adjust the threshold so 
that the CWT bar graph segment flashes in time 
with the incoming CW. Use higher RX THRn 
settings for stronger signals as well as faster CW 
speeds. 
§ 
In CW, PSK-D and FSK-D modes, transmitted text 
can be captured (see MENU:LOGGING).  
§ 
Use a filter bandwidth of 0.30 kHz or less. 
§ 
For further details on data modes, see pg. 27.

Split Operation 
Often you’ll hear a DX station being called by many 
stations, creating a pileup. To ensure that he has a clear 
transmit channel, the DX station may say “UP” or 
“DOWN” periodically to indicate that he’s listening 
above or below his transmit frequency. For example, in 
CW mode he might transmit on 14025 kHz, but listen 
in the vicinity of 14027 kHz. In this case he would 
periodically send “UP 2” (or just “UP”) as a reminder 
of where to call him. SSB pileup-split operation is 
similar but may occur over a much wider range. 
To use split, first hold A > B twice to set VFO B to the 
same mode, frequency, and filter settings as VFO A. 
Then tune VFO B up about 2 kHz (or the desired 
offset). Finally, hold SPLIT. The SPLIT icon will turn 
on, and the TX icon will point at VFO B, since VFO B 
is now controlling your transmit frequency. 
Using dual watch with and without SPLIT 
DX stations will tune in the vicinity of their specified 
listening frequency when searching for callers. Finding 
a clear spot in which to transmit will improve your 
chance of being heard. This is where dual watch comes 
in. With dual watch ON, you can listen to your RX and 
TX frequencies at the same time (pg. 25). You’ll be 
able to tune VFO B to find a clear spot, while still 
listening to the DX station at VFO A’s frequency. VFO 
B can be set up to 7 kHz above or 23 kHz below VFO 
A. Outside this range, dual watch is disabled, and the 
SUB icon flashes as a reminder.  
If an SSB-mode pileup extends more than 7 kHz above 
the DX station, you can use a different technique that 
allows you to transmit as much as to 23 kHz up. To do 
this, simply turn split OFF (VFO A will then be the TX 
VFO), and listen to the DX station with VFO B (using 
dual watch). This is actually easier than normal split 
operation, because VFO A has a larger tuning knob.   
Digital Voice Recorder (DVR) 
You can record two SSB-mode transmit voice 
messages of up to 15 s each, such as your call sign or a 
CQ, and play them back one time or with auto-repeat. 
This can save your voice, especially in an SSB contest. 
For example, you could record your callsign in one 
message and a fixed exchange in the other. 
  The transmit voice monitor should be used so 
you can hear DVR playback. This can be adjusted in 
receive mode. First, tap  
 AF/MON  to select the 
monitor level function. Then, while speaking into the 
mic, use this knob to adjust the level. Start with 5. 
DVR Record: 
Hold REC , then tap 1 or 2 on the numeric keypad. The 
current message will be erased (4 s). When prompted, 
tap XMIT and start speaking into the mic (no need to 
push PTT). Tap XMIT again to terminate record. MIC 
gain cannot be adjusted during DVR message play. 
The gain setting at time of recording is used.  
DVR Play: 
Tap MSG , then tap 1 or 2. To cancel, tap XMIT  or hit 
the key. To auto-repeat a message, tap MSG , but then 
hold rather than tap  1 or  2.  MENU:MSG RPT sets 
the repeat interval (1 to 255 seconds).

Transmit Noise Gate 
The noise gate function mutes mic audio below a 
selected audio threshold. This is useful in vehicles and 
when operating in noisy outdoor environments. See 
MENU:TX GATE for details. 
Cross-Mode Operation 
Cross-mode operation is possible in some cases. For 
example, you could set up VFO A for SSB receive, and 
VFO B for CW transmit, then enter SPLIT. When you 
transmit, the SSB station will hear your CW signal at 
the pitch of your sideone. Use a fairly slow CW speed, 
e.g. 15 WPM, if you’re not sure of the SSB operator’s 
code proficiency level. 
  You can also send CW in SSB mode without using 
split, if the CW-in-SSB feature is enabled. See 
MENU:CW WGHT for details. 
 
Custom Power-On Banner 
Your KX2 can display a customized text “banner” on 
power-up, such as your name and callsign. The banner 
scrolls across the VFO B display.  
 
To set up a banner, use the Configuration screen of the 
KX2 Utility application.

Logging (CW/Data Modes) 
When using the KX2 hand-held, or if operating time is 
very limited, logging may be inconvenient. The KX2 
can capture up to 2048 transmitted characters, along 
with time, band, and mode data, so you can update a 
paper or electronic log later on. Log data can be 
reviewed at the KX2 itself using the DISP/LOG 
function, or by sending the data to KX2 Utility. 
Logging applies only to CW (C), PSK-D (P) and FSK-
D (F) modes, and requires use of the internal keyer, 
either with a separate or attached paddle. 
For complete instructions see MENU:LOGGING. 
Transverter Bands 
Seven user-definable band displays are provided for 
use with external transverters, such as the Elecraft XV-
Series. (FM mode provides PL tone encode and offsets 
for use with VHF/UHF repeaters; see pg. 22.) 
  The KX2 does not have a low-level transverter 
output; transverters are driven from the main 
antenna jack. This requires the use of transverters that 
have a common receive/transmit antenna jack and 
associated T/R switching. Consult the transverter 
manual for drive power limitations and switching 
requirements. 
The KX2’s ACC jack provides a keyline output that 
can be used to key transverters. See pg. 9. 
Transverter Band Setup 
Transverter bands are set up using the five XV menu 
entries, as follows: 
 
§ 
Locate the XVn ON menu entry. Tap 1 – 7 to 
specify which transverter band to configure. Set 
the parameter to YES to enable band n.  
§ 
XVn RF sets the operating frequency (MHz). 
§ 
XVn IF specifies the I.F. band (7, 14, 21, 28, or 50 
MHz). Most transverters use a 28 MHz I.F. 
§ 
XVn PWR sets maximum KX2 power output for 
the current transverter band in watts. 
§ 
XVn OFS can compensate for a frequency offset 
in the transverter.

Options and Accessories 
This section describes all available KX2 options and 
accessories. Option modules are easily user-installable, 
in any order, without soldering.  
AX-Line Whip Antennas:  These 4 foot (1.2 m) 
telescoping whips are ideal for pedestrian mobile 
(hand-held) and general field use. They disassemble 
into two pieces so they’ll fit into a pocket or our CS40 
bag. Options include the AXE1 40 m extender. 
MH3 hand mic: The MH3 microphone includes a 
high-quality element, space-saving right-angle plug, 
PTT switch, and VFO UP/DN function buttons.  
KXPD2 keyer paddle: The KXPD2 is a very compact 
keyer paddle that attaches directly to the KX2 (or 
KX3), eliminating the need for a heavy external keyer. 
  A KXPD3 keyer paddle can also be used with 
the KX2, though a modification may be required. 
Contact Elecraft for KXPD3 modification instructions. 
KXIBC2 internal battery charger and RTC: The 
KXIBC2 safely and automatically charges the KXBT2 
battery. It also provides a real-time-clock (RTC; see 
pg. 23 and the TIME menu entry). The RTC is used 
with logging functions (see MENU:LOGGING).  
KXIO2 Aux I/O and RTC: The KXIO2 provides two 
user-programmable outputs (AUX jack; see the AUX 1 
and AUX 2 menu entries). Its RTC supports the same 
time and logging functions as the KXIBC2 (see above). 
  Either a KXIBC2 OR a KXIO2 can be installed. 
KXAT2 wide-range internal automatic antenna 
tuner (ATU): With a KXAT2 installed, you can use 
non-resonant and narrow-band antennas. An ATU can 
improve transmit power output and receive sensitivity. 
The ATU provides two sets of tuning data for use at 
home and field locations (see MENU:ATU DATA). 
KXPA100 100-watt amplifier: The KXPA100 is a 
rugged 100 W, 160-6 m linear amplifier that can be 
used with the KX2, KX3, or any other QRP 
transceivesr. An internal 100 W ATU is also available 
for the amplifier (KXAT100). The KX2 can remotely 
tune the 100 W ATU (pg. 19) and control its antenna 
switch (MENU:ANT.X SW). If a KXAT100 is 
available, the the KX2’s internal ATU (KXAT2) will 
be placed into bypass mode automatically. 
  A KX2 Accessory Cable (KX2ACBL) is required 
to split the KX2’s ACC jack into two jacks: KEY OUT 
(2.5 mm) and serial I/O (3.5 mm). The KXPA100 
comes with cables that plug into these two jacks. 
CS40 and ES60 carrying cases: These are high-
quality, padded carrying cases with an internal 
zippered compartment. The CS40 is extremely 
compact, with space for the KX2, an AX-line whip 
antenna, ground wire, an earbud-style headset, a few 
adapters, and a small paper log. The larger ES60 has 
space for an MH3 microphone and additional items. 
KX2GNDPLUG: This mini-banana plug can be used 
to make a quick-disconnect ground wire (pg. 10). 
BNC-BP:  BNC to binding-post adapter for secure 
attachment of wire antennas to the KX2 (pg. 10).

Firmware Upgrades  
New features and improvements are available to all 
KX2 owners via free firmware upgrades. Upgrades 
may also be required when you install option modules.  
Please visit the Elecraft software page:   
https://elecraft.com/pages/firmware-software 
 to obtain our free firmware download application, 
KX2 Utility. This program runs on PCs, Macs, and 
Linux platforms. In addition to firmware downloading, 
KX2 Utility provides automated TX gain calibration, a 
custom power-on banner, configuration save/restore, 
CW/DATA message editing, and a CW/DATA 
terminal function. 
Connecting the KX2 to a Computer 
The KX2 is supplied with cable for connection to a 
computer. The standard cable is model KXUSB, for 
use with a USB port. Cable model KXSER is available 
for use with an RS232 port.  
At the KX2 end, connect this cable to the 3.5 mm ACC 
jack. (ACC cable pinout is shown on pg. 9 for 
reference.) 
Within KX2 Utility, select the new USB or RS232  
com port associated with the KX2’s serial cable. 
  Some applications or peripheral devices may 
interfere with KX2 downloads; check the Help 
information in KX2 Utility if you have difficulty. 
Checking your Firmware Revision 
Use the FW REVS menu entry to determine your 
firmware revision. The serial number of your 
transceiver, if needed, can be obtained using the SER 
NUM menu entry. 
 
KX2 Firmware Self-Test 
If the KX2 detects an error in its firmware (an incorrect 
checksum of all bytes in the program), it will flash the 
TX LED and show MCU LD on the LCD. 
If this occurs, connect the KX2 to your computer, then 
run KX2 Utility, which will reload the firmware. While 
firmware is loading, the Delta-F LED (∆f) will flash. 
When the download is complete, the KX2 should reset 
and run normally.   
Forcing a Firmware Download 
If you accidentally load an old or incompatible 
firmware version and find the KX2 unresponsive, do 
the following: (1) Unplug the KX2 from the power 
supply. If an internal battery pack is installed, 
disconnect and remove it. (2) Plug a power supply in 
(or reinstall the removed battery). (3) hold the KX2’s 
RATE and  A/B  switches simultaneously for about 10 
seconds, after which you’ll see the TX LED flash 
(you’ll also see MCU LD on the LCD). (4) Connect 
the KX2 to a computer and run KX2 Utility, which will 
load new firmware.

Remote Control of the KX2 
Computer Control and Logging 
With appropriate software, any computer with an 
RS232 or USB port can be used to control the KX2. 
See Connecting the KX2 to a Computer (pg. 34). 
Third-party logging and contesting software is 
available for various computers and operating systems. 
Select KX2 as the target radio when available. If not, 
select another Elecraft transceiver. 
For a list of compatible software applications, 
including configuration requirements, please visit  
      http://www.elecraft.com/k2_remote.htm 
Remote-Control Commands 
The KX2 has a rich set of remote-control commands. 
These commands use ordinary ASCII characters, so 
they can be easily tested using a terminal emulator or 
the Command Tester screen in KX2 Utility. For 
example, the command “FA;” returns the current VFO 
A frequency. Using the same command, you can set 
the frequency, e.g. “FA00007040000;” sets the VFO to 
7.040 MHz. The “LG;” command lists the contents of 
the KX2’s built-in transmit log (MENU:LOGGING). 
Many specialized commands are provided in addition 
to the core set of commands supported by the K3S/K3. 
Please refer to the K3S/K3/KX3/KX2 Programmer’s 
Reference for further details. 
Automatic Antenna Control 
Some antenna control units (e.g., those used with 
SteppIR™ antennas) can track the KX2’s band and  
frequency by watching for “IF;” (rig information) 
packets from the transceiver’s serial port (ACC jack). 
To configure the KX2 to send these packets, set 
MENU:AUTOINF to ANT CTRL. The packets are 
sent once per second while the VFO frequency is being 
changed, as well as on band or mode change. 
CW/DATA Terminal Applications 
The KX2 can handle CW/PSK/RTTY ASCII text 
transmit and receive via its ACC port (RS232 or USB). 
Our KX2 Utility application includes a Terminal 
function that lets you use these modes with your 
computer’s keyboard and monitor. At the KX2, select 
FSK-D data submode for RTTY, PSK-D for PSK31 or 
PSK63, or CW. Then follow the Help instructions 
within KX2 Utility.  
Elecraft Frequency Memory Editor  
The KX2’s frequency memories (pg. 24) can be easily 
viewed and changed using our Elecraft Frequency 
Memory Editor. This program shows the contents of 
all 100 regular memories, as well as per-band quick-
memories, in a spreadsheet format. You can also set 
VFO A directly to a memory from within the program.

Configuration 
Option Module Enables 
Whenever an option is installed, use the associated 
menu entry to set it up (see Menu Functions, pg. 41). 
When installing internal options, open the KX2 
enclosure using the procedure on pg. 6. 
§ 
KXAT2 Antenna Tuner (ATU): Set ATU MD to 
AUTO. Exit the menu and turn the KX2 off, then 
back on. See pg. 19 for ATU controls. 
§ 
KXPD2 (or KXPD3) Keyer Paddle: Set 
MENU:CW KEY2 to LeFT paddle  = DOT 
(normal) or  = DASH (reverse). If you set it to 
HAND, either paddle can be used as a hand key. 
(The KEY jack is configured using MENU:CW 
KEY1, independent of the KXPD2 or KXPD3.) 
§ 
KXIO2 Aux I/O and RTC: Set the KXIO2 menu 
entry to NOR. Exit the menu and turn the KX2 
off/on. See MENU:TIME, AUX 1 and AUX 2. 
§ 
KXIBC2 Internal Charger and RTC:  Set the 
KXIBC2 menu entry to NOR. Exit the menu and 
turn the KX2 off/on. See MENU:TIME. 
§ 
KXPA100 External 100-W amplifier: See       
PA MODE menu entry and KXPA100 manual. 
 
  After changing option enables, use KX2 Utility 
to save your configuration. 
 
Menu Settings 
The menu entries described in this section are often 
used to tailor the KX2 to the operator’s requirements. 
You may also wish to review the full list of menu 
entries, starting on pg. 41. 
Auto Power-Off 
The KX2 can turn itself off after a specified period of 
inactivity (i.e., no use of the controls). Use the 
AUTOOFF menu entry to select the time period in 
minutes. The default is INFINITE.  
Low-Battery Warning 
You can set BAT MIN to warn you when an internal or 
external battery is approaching end of charge. BAT 
LOW is displayed periodically when this level is 
reached. The default voltage (10.0 V) is appropriate 
for many 12 V batteries, as well as the specified 
internal 11 V battery. 
  The KX2 will turn itself off when the supply 
voltage drops below about 7.5 volts, regardless of the 
BAT MIN  setting. 
CW Iambic Mode 
CW users can specify Iambic mode A or B using the 
CW IAMB menu entry. The default is mode A, which 
is a little more forgiving. Mode B may be preferred by 
operators who do “squeeze” keying. Both modes 
provide dot- and dash-memories—enabling fast code 
speeds—but with slightly different timing. 

============================================================
PAGE 37
============================================================

37 
Microphone Settings 
If you plan to use voice modes, set up MIC BIAS and 
MIC BTN to match your microphone. 
Switch-Press Tones and Morse User Interface 
Switch-press tones are enabled by default. Using the            
SW TONE menu entry, you can turn tones OFF, ON, 
or select Morse code tones at various speeds (CODE 
nn). Switch tones use the CW sidetone volume level, 
which can be adjusted in CW mode using the              
 AF/MON  control. 
A document titled “KX2 CW UI,” available on our 
KX2 manuals page, provides full details on the Morse 
user interface. It also includes text descriptions of the 
KX2 controls for blind operators. 
Setting the Time 
MENU:TIME sets the 24-hour real-time-clock (RTC) 
if a KXIO2 or KXIBC2 module is installed and the 
associated menu entry is set to NOR. If no KXIO2 or 
KXIBC2 module is installed, time will start at 
00:00:00 at power-up, though you might still want to 
set it for time-stamping CW/DATA log text (see 
MENU:LOGGING). 
While in the menu entry, tap  1 / 2 / 3 to select 
HH/MM/SS (hours/minutes/seconds), respectively. 
Then use VFO A to adjust the value. KX2 Utility can 
also be used to accurately set the time. 
To display the present time, tap DISP and rotate        
 OFS/B  to locate the time display.  
If the clock appears to be off by more than +/- 2 
seconds per day, use the RTC ADJ menu entry to 
apply a correction.  
  The clock circuitry must be powered by either the 
KX2’s internal battery or an external supply. Refer to 
the KXIO2 or KXIO2 menu entry for details. 
VFO Coarse Tuning Steps 
VFO CRS can be used to set up a coarse tuning 
increment for each mode. Tap RATE to select normal 
or coarse tuning. 
TUNE Power Level 
If you’re using an external antenna tuner or amplifier 
with the KX2, you may want to limit the power level 
used during TUNE. The TUN PWR menu entry can be 
used to set the desired power level.  
  If you have the KXAT2 internal ATU installed, 
power is automatically set to 3.0 watts during antenna 
tuning. There’s no need to configure  TUN PWR  in 
this case.  
VOX (Voice Operated Transmit) Setup 
If you plan to use VOX in voice or data modes, you’ll 
need to set up the VOX GN and VOX INH (anti-VOX) 
menu entries. See pg. 20. 
 
  After changing menu settings, use KX2 Utility to 
save your present configuration. The configuration 
can be restored later if required.

parameter to ON. Then exit the menu. 
To unlock the parameter for any tech-mode menu 
entry:  Hold FREQ until you see the lock symbol          
(
) turn off (about 3 seconds).  
Reference Frequency 
Using the calibration procedure below, you can 
achieve accuracy of better than +/- 10 Hz. This 
procedure requires a stable signal generator, or an on-
air signal at a known frequency, such as WWV at 5, 
10, or 15 MHz. The carrier of a commercial AM 
broadcast station can also be used. 
§ 
Select CW mode by tapping MODE.  
§ 
Hold MENU. Rotate  
 OFS/B  to find DUAL 
RX. Set it to OFF. Next, locate MENU:CWT and 
set it to ON. Then exit the menu. 
§ 
If you’re using a signal generator, set  
 PWR to 
0.0 watts to avoid damaging it.  
§ 
Use direct frequency entry (pg. 15) to set VFO A 
to the exact frequency of your signal generator or 
on-air signal source.  
§

Receive Opposite Sideband 
Receive sideband calibration nulls (rejects) the 
opposite-sideband image. This image is a weak audible 
side-effect of listening to very strong signals. 
  This procedure is normally done only at the 
factory. Instructions available on request. 
Transmit Bias 
This automated procedure sets the transmit bias current 
of the 10 W amplifier stage to ensure low distortion.  
 
§ 
Make sure nothing is connected to the KX2’s 
antenna jack. 
§ 
Hold MENU, then rotate  
 OFS/B  to locate the

Transmit Carrier 
In SSB and some data modes, a transmitter’s primary 
signal may be accompanied by a weak unmodulated 
signal called a carrier about 1 kHz away. The carrier 
should be suppressed (or nulled) to minimize 
interference to nearby stations. The TXCRNUL menu 
entry is used for this purpose. 
  This procedure requires a spectrum analyzer, 
and is normally done only at the factory. 
Instructions available on request. 
 
 
 
Transmit Opposite Sideband 
In SSB and some data modes, a transmitter’s primary 
signal may be accompanied by a weak opposite 
sideband signal about 2 kHz away. This signal should 
be suppressed (or nulled) to minimize interference to 
nearby stations. The TXSBNUL menu entry is used for 
this purpose. 
  This procedure requires a spectrum analyzer, 
and is normally done only at the factory. 
Instructions available on request.

Menu Functions 
Hold  MENU  to enter the KX2’s menu. Tap or hold this switch to exit. Up to four menu entries that you’d like 
quick access to can be assigned to programmable functions PF1-PF4 using PFn, the programmable function switch 
(pg. 25). Note:  NOR appears in some parameter displays. This means “Normal,” i.e. the default or recommended 
value. 
Menu Help Information 
Holding  MENU  for about 3 seconds while in the menu shows information about the present menu entry on VFO 
B. For most entries, the default parameter value is shown in parentheses at the start of the help text. Tap the switch 
to terminate the help text display. 
Tech-Mode menu entries  
The 
 symbol in the table below indicates a tech mode menu entry. These are typically used for calibration. Their 
parameter values are locked by default, as indicated by the lock symbol on the display. To reveal all tech-mode 
menu entries, set  MENU:TECH MD  to ON. To change any tech-mode parameter, you must first unlock it by 
holding FREQ for about 3 seconds. This turns off the lock symbol. 
 
Entry 
Default 
Description 
2 TONE 
 
OFF 
Enables built-in 2-tone generator for SSB transmit tests. The internal 2-tone 
generator only works if LSB or USB mode is selected. After setting 2-tone ON, 
exit the menu and tap XMIT.  
AF LIM 
NOR 030 
Adjustable AF output limiter for use when AGC is turned off (MENU:AGC MD). 
This can protect your ears if a large signal appears. Signals or noise above the 
threshold will sound distorted due to the limiting, reminding you to back down AF 
gain (or RF gain, if you’re using MENU:RF GAIN to control receive gain). 
Typical settings for those who often turn AGC off are 17 to 23. 
AFX MD 
Delay 
DELAY setting (default) provides quasi-stereo audio, reducing operating fatigue 
when using stereo headphones or dual external speakers.  
AGC MD 
ON 
Some operators prefer to turn AGC off and control RF gain manually. This can be 
done with the preamp and attenuator, or using MENU:RF GAIN. (When AGC is 

============================================================
PAGE 42
============================================================

42 
off, the AGC icons on the LCD change to AGC-, with the “minus” sign meaning 
“off”. Turning AGC off also disables noise reduction.)  
If an uncomfortably-strong signal appears in your headphones or speaker with 
AGC off, reduce the threshold of the AGC-off audio limiter (MENU:AF LIM). 
AGC SPD 
SLO 
This setting is stored per-mode. The default for CW mode is FAST, and for other 
modes, SLO. The setting is indicated by the AGC S and F display icons. 
AGC*THR 
007 
This menu entry provides access to several AGC parameters,  each of which starts 
with  AGC*. For most purposes the defaults will suffice. Tap the 1 through 6 
switches to access the following parameters (defaults in parentheses):  
1  AGC*THR (007):  Threshold at which AGC action begins. A higher number 
moves the threshold up, providing greater audio dynamic range. 
2  AGC*ATK (215):  Rate of AGC attack. A lower number than the default 
provides a softer attack but may also result in overshoot.  
3  AGC*HLD (000):  Hold time in seconds for voice modes. Prevents AGC decay 
for a specified time after attack, reducing AGC interaction with signals. 
4  AGC*DCY (Fast, 140; Slow, 040):  Specifies the decay rate for slow or fast 
AGC (see AGC SPD menu entry). A larger number means a faster decay. 
5  AGC*SLP (015):  The higher the slope number, the "flatter" the AGC response 
is. With a high setting of slope, signals above the AGC threshold will be held close 
in audio amplitude even if they vary in strength at the RF input. 
6  AGC*PLS (NOR):   Noise pulse rejection. Prevents the AGC (and S-meter) 
from charging up on one-shot noise events. Set it to OFF to disable this feature. 
ALT MD 
NOR 
CW mode:  If set to NOR, CW normal will be in effect on the present band. Set to 
ALT to use CW reverse mode instead (REV icon turns on).  CW normal uses LSB 
(lower sideband), while CW reverse uses USB (upper sideband). This selection 
affects the direction of VFO tuning for increasing pitch as CW signals are tuned in. 
In some cases switching from one to the other can reduce QRM. 
SSB mode:  If set the NOR, the sideband normally used on the present band will 
be in effect: LSB on 160, 80, and 40 meters, and USB on 60, 30, 20, 17, 12, and 10 
m. Setting ALT MD to ALT will select the other sideband for the present band. 

============================================================
PAGE 43
============================================================

43 
DATA modes: DATA A and PSK D normally use USB, while AFSK A and      
FSK D use LSB. ALT selects the other sideband (data reverse) for the current data 
submode, turning on the REV icon. 
AM MODE 
ON 
Set to ON to enable AM mode. You can copy AM signals using SSB modes. 
AMP HRS 
N/A 
Shows total amp hours used by the KX2. This is useful for testing battery packs, 
estimating remaining battery charge, or tracking the amp hours needed to complete 
one or more objectives (e.g., a certain number of QSOs at a given power level).  
The value is preserved on power-off, so it can show amp hours used over any 
number of operating sessions. Holding CLR resets the value to 0.000; this is 
typically done after swapping in a fresh battery. (Amp hours is also one of the 
special VFO B displays; tap DISP, then rotate VFO B until you see n.nnnAH. 
This display persists during transmit so you can monitor the rate of increase. 
In receive mode, the amp hour value will go up by .001 every 20-25 seconds. In 
transmit mode, the value will go up by .001 every 2 to 10 seconds, depending on 
operating mode, power setting, and antenna load impedance (all three can affect 
current drain). 
ANT.X SW 
1 
This menu entry (eXternal Antenna switch) can be used to remotely select antenna 
1 or 2 on the KXPA100. Requirements:  (1) a KXPA100 with the KXAT100 ATU 
option must be connected to the KX2 via the amplifier control cable; (2) the KX2’s  
PA MODE menu entry must be set to ON. 
ATU DATA 
SET 1 
The KX2 stores two full sets of per-band data for the internal ATU (KXAT2). This 
menu entry selects which set to use. Typically SET 1 is used at a home location, 
and SET 2 for field operation. The two sets can also be used in cases where two 
antennas are available for a given band. (Note: This menu entry has no effect on 
KXAT100 ATU data, which is already stored separately for each of the KXPA100 
amplifier’s antenna jacks. The KX2 can remotely switch KXPA100 antennas using 
the ANT.X SW menu entry.) 
Holding CLR while in this menu entry clears stored LC data only for the currently 
selected set on the present band.  
In the ATU DATA and ATU MD menu entries, tapping  ATU  shows the present 
values of L (inductance), C (capacitance) and N (L-network configuration). This 

============================================================
PAGE 44
============================================================

44 
applies only to the internal ATU (KXAT2). The displayed data format is 
LxxCxxNy. <xx> is a 2-digit hexadecimal value that, when converted to binary, 
shows which ATU L or C relays are engaged. <y> shows which side of the L-
network the capacitance is on: Nt = TX side, and NA = antenna side. 
ATU MD 
ATU.X MD 
Not Inst 
Normally, this menu entry’s name is ATU MD, and it controls the mode of the 
KX2’s internal automatic antenna tuner (KXAT2 option).  
If a KXPA100 with a KXAT100 ATU option is connected via the remote-control 
cable, and PA MODE is ON, the menu entry changes to ATU.X MD (.X = 
eXternal). In this case the menu entry controls the auto-tune mode of the 
KXAT100.  
The parameter is normally set to BYP or AUTO. Modes L1-L7, C1-C7, and Ct 
are used to test the KXAT2’s relays and L-network (not applicable to the 
KXAT100).  
Holding CLR while in this menu entry clears stored LC data for the present band. 
If the KXAT100 is in use, the data for the currently selected antenna is cleared. If 
the internal ATU is in use, data for the current ATU DATA set is cleared. 
AUTO INF 
 
NOR 
If set to ANT CTRL, the KX2 will send band data (“automatic info”) to its ACC 
jack for use with devices such as SteppIR™ antennas. The data is sent on every 
band or mode change, and once per second as the VFO is moved. See pg. 35. 
AUTO OFF 
INFINITE 
Sets auto-power-off time from 5 to 100 minutes. (The countdown is restarted when 
any control is used, and by any transmission.) If set to INFINITE, power is never 
turned off. A setting of 5 or 10 minutes is recommended when running from 
batteries. 
AUX 1 and    
AUX 2 
OFF 
Used to set the KXIO2 option module’s AUX outputs to ON or OFF on a per-band 
basis.  
Details: The AUX jack provides a ground (0 V) and two open-drain output 
signals: AUX 1 and AUX 2. Open-drain outputs simulate a contact closure to 
ground when in the ON condition, and are floating (high-impedance) when OFF. 
Typically, the ON state would be used to turn on a relay connected to a DC supply 
voltage (28 V max, 150 mA max).  

============================================================
PAGE 45
============================================================

45 
The two outputs could be used singly or in combination to switch an external 
device such as an antenna switch, select taps on a loading coil, etc. This could be 
especially useful during mobile operation. (Note: Elecraft does not yet offer any 
products that make use of the AUX outputs, but may in the future.) 
BAT MIN 
10.0 
Low-battery warning threshold. The default (10.0 volts) is sufficient for use with 
some 12 V batteries such as gel cells, as well as for the specified 11 V Li-ion 
battery pack. If the internal battery or external supply/battery voltage drops below 
the selected level, the operator will be alerted with BAT LOW messages every 
few minutes. Regardless of this setting, the KX2 will turn itself off if the supply 
voltage drops below 7.5 V. 
To extend battery life, turn the backlight and preamp off when not needed, and use 
headphones rather than the internal speaker. 
BKLIGHT 
ON 
LCD backlight on/off. The display is transflective, so it can be seen in sunlight 
with the backlight turned off. Turning it off will extend battery life. 
COR LVL 
 
NOR 0.1 
Sets the carrier-operated-relay (COR) threshold. The COR is used to detect, and 
protect the KX2’s receiver from a transmitter being used nearby. 0.1 watts is the 
default and recommended level. See Troubleshooting for other suggestions. 
CW IAMB 
A 
Iambic keying mode (A or B). The default is mode A, which is a little more 
forgiving for first-time operators. Mode B may be preferred by operators who 
learned to do “squeeze-keying” with another keyer having this or a similar mode. 
Both modes provide dot- and dash-memories—enabling fast code speeds—but 
with slightly different “element-insert” timing. 
CW KEY1 
TIP=DOT 
Specifies whether the left keyer paddle (tip contact on the KEY jack) is DOT or 
DASH. A third selection, HAND, allows either tip or ring to function as a hand 
key, or as an input for an external keying device (keyer, computer, etc.). 
CW KEY2 
LFT=DOT 
Specifies whether the left lever of a KXPD2 (or KXPD3) keyer paddle is DOT or 
DASH. A third selection, HAND, allows either lever to function as a hand key, or 
as an input for an external keying device (keyer, computer, etc.). 
CWT 
OFF 
When set to ON, the upper half of the S-meter becomes a tuning aid for CW, 
PSK31/63 (PSK D mode), or RTTY (FSK-D mode) signals. Also, when CWT is 
on in CW or PSK D modes, the manual signal spotting function of the KYR-

============================================================
PAGE 46
============================================================

46 
SPT/MIC knob changes to auto-spot (pg. 21). In this case the KX2 will attempt to 
to tune in CW or PSK31/63 signals automatically. 
CW WGHT 
1.25 
Adjusts element/space timing ratio (weight) for the internal keyer.  
Additional functions of this menu entry, via numeric keypad: 
Tap 1 to select SSB -CW (default) or SSB +CW (allows CW in SSB modes). 
When CW-in-SSB is in effect, tapping the KYR-SPT/MIC knob in SSB mode 
alternates between keyer speed and mic gain rather than CMP/ALC and SWR/RF 
transmit metering. CW transmit in SSB mode is not available if SPLIT is on. 
Tap 3 to select NOR QSK (default) or FST QSK. The FST (fast) setting 
provides somewhat faster receive recovery time, while NOR (normal) is less 
susceptible to audio artifacts from noise and nearby interfering stations. 
Tap 4 to select VOX NOR (default) or AUTO OFF. The AUTO OFF setting 
turns CW VOX off on power-up, avoiding accidental keying by attached PCs, etc. 
Tap 5 to select automatic VFO offset on any SSB/CW mode change (VFO OFS). 
VFO NOR, the default, disables the offset. Automatic offset is useful when 
mixed-mode QSOs are necessary, as during fading.  Note:  Pitch matching for 
automatic offset will be more accurate if USB is paired with CW reverse, and LSB 
with CW normal. See MENU:ALT MD. 
DUAL RX 
OFF 
Set to AUTO to enable Dual Watch (pg. 25). The SUB icon will turn on. If the 
VFOs are not within the required range, the SUB icon will flash slowly. Note: 
Dual watch only applies when using stereo headphones or dual external speakers. 
FM DEV 
 
and PL DEV 
5.0 
0.3 
Sets FM deviation. Tap 1 to alternate between FM DEV (voice deviation) and PL 
DEV  (PL tone deviation). 
FM MODE 
 
Set to ON to enable FM mode. Also see the FM DEV,  FM TONE, and RPT OFS 
menu entries, as well as Channel Hopping (pg. 24). 
FM TONE 
PL OFF 
Tap 1 to turn on PL tone encode (CTCSS). Rotate VFO A to select the tone pitch. 
Tones are stored in frequency memories. 
FW REVS 
 
N/A 
Rotate VFO A to see firmware revisions: MCU (µC, shorthand for 
microcontroller), DSP (dSP), and KXPA100 amplifier MCU if applicable (PA). 
Tap 1  to see the RF board revision, e.g. “RFPCB=A” for rev. A.

KXIBC2 
Not Inst 
If a KXIBC2 module is installed, set the parameter to NOR, then exit the menu 
and turn the KX2 off/on. Note: This will automatically set the KXIO2’s menu 
parameter to Not Inst, since only one module or the other may be installed. 
To set the time, use the TIME menu entry. Use the RTC ADJ menu entry to 
improve the clock’s long-term accuracy if desired.   
KXIO2 
Not inst 
If a KXIO2 module is installed, set the parameter to NOR, then exit the menu and 
turn the KX2 off/on. To set the time, use the TIME menu entry. Use the RTC ADJ 
menu entry to improve the clock’s long-term accuracy if desired.  
Note: The real-time clock circuitry must normally be powered by either the KX2’s 
internal battery or an external power source. As a convenience for recharging the 
battery, which must be done externally to the KX2, the clock will keep time for up 
to about 2 hours with no power supply or battery connected. This capability is 
provided by a supercapacitor on the KXIO2 module (see pg. 7). 
The KXIO2 also provides two open-drain signals on its AUX jack. These could be 
used for antenna switching or other applications. See the AUX 1 and AUX 2 menu 
entries. 
LCDTEST 
OFF 
Rotate VFO A to turn on all LCD segments for test purposes. 
LED BRT 
4 
In the case where the LCD backlight is turned OFF, this menu entry adjusts 
brightness of the discrete LEDs (TX, delta-F, OFS, and VFO B LED). Does not set 
brightness of the LCD backlight itself (for that adjustment, use BKLIGHT). 
LOGGING 
OFF 
When using the KX2 hand-held, or if operating time is very limited, logging may 
be inconvenient. The KX2 can capture up to 2048 transmitted characters, along 
with time, band, and mode, so you can update a paper or electronic logbook later 
on. To enable logging, set this menu entry to ON. Logging applies to CW (C), 
PSK-D (P) and FSK-D (F) modes, and only when using the internal keyer.  
To take advantage of time stamping, either set the time on every power-up of the 
KX2 (MENU:TIME), or install a KXIBC2 or KXIO2 option module (see Options). 
When logging is enabled and there’s room available, the DVR icon (above the S-
meter) flashes slowly. Outgoing text decode is turned on, allowing you to make 
sure you’ve sent call signs accurately. If you fill the log, LOG FULL is flashed. 
To review log text, tap DISP and use VFO B to find the LOG display. The VFO A 

============================================================
PAGE 48
============================================================

48 
knob can then be used to scroll. Time/mode/band (MHz) are shown on VFO A 
(e.g., “0023 C14”); text is shown on VFO B. Holding CLR erases the entire log. To 
“dump” the log, send “LG;” to the KX2 via KX2 Utility’s Command Tester screen. 
Tips: To conserve space, use message buffers (MSG) to send CQs, name/QTH, 
etc. Messages are recorded in the log. To start/stop logging quickly, assign 
MENU:LOGGING to a programmable function switch (PF1-PF4). 
MIC BIAS 
ON 
Set to ON for the Elecraft MH3. (Not applicable to the internal mic.) You may 
need to try both MIC BIAS settings to see which works best with other mics. 
Monitor your transmitted signal with another receiver when testing mic audio. 
MIC BTN 
PTT 
UP.DN 
If your mic has both a PTT switch and UP/DN buttons, set the parameter to             
PTT UP.DN. This applies to the Elecraft MH3. If the mic has PTT but no UP/DN 
buttons, use PTT. Otherwise, use OFF. This setting applies to most headset-mics, 
including the Heil models available from Elecraft. Third-party mics may not have a 
KX2-compatible PTT (push-to-talk) switch. You can still key the transmitter either 
by tapping the XMIT switch or by using VOX (pg. 20). 
MSG RPT 
6 
Message repeat interval in seconds (0 to 255). To repeat a message, hold a 
message button  (1 – 3) rather than tap. A 6 - 10 sec. interval is about right for 
casual CQing. Shorter intervals may be needed during contests, and longer for 
periodic CW beacons. 
PA MODE 
OFF 
Sets the operating mode for Elecraft KXPA100 amplifier and its internal ATU.  
Set to ON only if the KX2 is connected to the KXPA100 via the KX2 Accessory 
Cable (KX2ACBL), which plugs into the ACC jack at the KX2. This allows the 
KX2 to control the amplifier’s output power and ATU tuning as described in the 
KXPA100 owner’s manual. ATU MD becomes ATU.X MD in this case, and the 
ANT.X SW menu entry can be used to switch antennas at the KXPA100. 
Set to OFF if there’s no attached KXPA100.  
Tap 1  to configure ALC for the KXPA100. Default is enabled (PA ALC+).             
Tap 6  to enable/disable display of unspecified KXPA100 error codes. Default is 
disabled (XFAULT-). 
If PA MODE is set to P out CAL, a KXPA100 is connected via the remote-
control cable, and PWR is set to CAL 75W, going into TUNE mode will calibrate 

============================================================
PAGE 49
============================================================

49 
the KX2’s drive level for 75 W output at the KXPA100, on the present band. This 
overrides the KXPA100’s factory aligned, per-band drive-power calibration, and 
should not be necessary under normal circumstances. Also see MENU:TX GAIN.  
PITCH 
0.60 
Sets the CW sidetone pitch in kHz. This is also the pitch of CW signals when 
centered in the receiver’s passband.  Note: In PSK-D mode (PSK31/63), the center 
pitch is 1000 Hz (fixed). In FSK-D mode (RTTY), the mark tone is 915 Hz (fixed). 
REF CAL 
 
25.000.000 
(+/- 1 kHz) 
Used to calibrate the KX2’s synthesizer; normally done at the factory. VFO A is 
used to set the reference frequency (typically 24.999-25.001 MHz). Refer to pg. 38 
for calibration details.  
RF GAIN 
NOR       
–0 dB 
Normally, RF GAIN is set to NOR  -0 dB (no gain reduction). However, some 
operators prefer to turn automatic gain control off (using MENU:AGC MD) and 
adjust RF gain manually, maximizing dynamic variability of received signals. As 
RF GAIN is advanced past -5 dB, a single bar on the S-meter starts at S-2 and 
moves upward as a reminder of how far gain has been reduced (-5 dB/unit). 
If desired, MENU:RF GAIN can be assigned to PF1-PF4 (pg. 25) for quick access.  
Note 1:  If you plan to turn AGC off as described above, you should set up the 
MENU:AF LIM parameter to avoid painful audio volume on strong signals.  
Note 2: RF gain is reset to -0 dB on power-up. Otherwise the operator might not 
be aware of a previous gain reduction used under different band conditions. 
Note 3:  As is the case with many software-defined transceivers, the KX2’s RF 
GAIN control is actually an input scaling factor applied within the DSP itself. 
Reducing RF gain doesn’t impact the strength of signals seen by the A-to-D 
converter (ADC; see glossary, pg. 67). Gain ahead of the ADC can only be reduced 
by turning the preamp off, and (if necessary) turning the attenuator on. 
RPT OFS 
0 
Sets repeater offset in kHz (applies only in FM mode). For 10 meters, use 100 kHz. 
To select  + / - / SIMPLEX operation, hold SPLIT . 
RS232 
4800 b 
This sets the RS232 (or USB) communications rate in bits per second (bps). During 
firmware download (via KX2 Utility), the baud rate is set automatically to 38400 
baud. It is then restored to the value selected in this menu entry. 

============================================================
PAGE 50
============================================================

50 
RTC ADJ 
0 
This parameter can be adjusted to improve the long-term accuracy of the real-time 
clock on the KXIBC2 or KXIO2 option. (MENU:KXIBC2 or MENU:KXIO2 must 
be set to NOR to use the RTC.) 
Note:  The KX2’s RTC is intended for general time-keeping and logging, not as a 
precision device for timing data transmissions (e.g. FT8). It is not automatically 
corrected like the clock on a laptop computer or other internet-connected device.  
Monitor your clock's accuracy over 24 hours, preferably at your typical ambient 
operating temperature. (The KX2 can be turned off during any portion of this 
monitor period, as long as an internal battery or external supply is attached.) If it's 
off by more than +/- 2 seconds per day, use RTC ADJ to compensate. For example, 
if it's slow by 5 seconds per day, set RTC ADJ to "-5 SEC". Allow a few hours, 
minimum, before making a further correction. 
RX EQ 
 
--------   
(+0 dB, 
each band) 
Receiver audio graphic equalizer. VFO A is used as an 8-band bar graph, showing 
boost or cut (-16 dB to +16 dB in 1 dB increments) for each AF band. The 8 
bands are 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.4 and 3.2 kHz. Tap 0-7 to select an AF 
band. VFO A selects boost/cut. Hold  CLR to reset all bands to +0 dB. 
CW and voice-mode RX EQ are separate. Not applicable to DATA modes. 
RXSBNUL 
 
GAIN nnn 
Used to null (reject) the receiver’s opposite-sideband image. If the menu name is 
RXSBNL*, then an extended per-band calibration procedure has been completed. 
Normally this is done at the factory. This procedure requires a 160-10 meter signal 
source (such as an Elecraft XG3); instructions are available on our website.  
Also see Receive Opposite Sideband calibration, pg. 39. 
SER NUM  
<S/N> 
Your KX2’s serial number, e.g. 05000. Cannot be changed. 
SW TEST 
 
OFF 
To turn on switch test, rotate VFO A until the parameter becomes SCN ADC. 
Then hold any switch to see its scan row and column ADC reading. 
SW TONE 
ON 
If set to ON, switch presses generate audible feedback tones. If set to CODE nn, 
Morse code characters are generated at nn WPM on control activation. The normal 
DISP switch function (special displays) is not available in this case. Instead, a tap 
of DISP reads out the operating mode and frequency in kHz, e.g. “U 238” for USB 
on 7.238 MHz. (Plain-text description of the full Morse UI available on request.) 

============================================================
PAGE 51
============================================================

51 
Holding the APF/AN switch during power-on will also turn on Morse feedback. 
Switch tone volume is the same as CW sidetone volume. It must be adjusted in CW 
mode, using  
 MON.  
Pitch of switch tones and Morse characters: In general, a low-to-high tone pair 
(or high-pitched Morse) is generated when a switch function is turned on, and 
high-to-low (or low-pitched Morse) when it is turned off. Some switches do not 
generate tones because they might interfere with received or transmitted audio. 
TECH MD 
OFF 
Set to ON to reveal Tech Mode menu entries (those marked with 
 in this list). 
TIME 
N/A 
Real-time-clock view/set. Tap 1 / 2 / 3 to set HH / MM / SS. To see the time and 
other displays during normal operation, tap DISP  (see pg. 23). Time is only 
maintained if a KXIBC2 or KXIO2 option module and an internal battery are 
installed. 
Also see the RTC ADJ menu entry, which may be used to improve the long-term 
accuracy of the real-time clock. 
Note: The clock circuitry must be powered by the KX2’s internal battery or an 
attached power supply. Refer to the KXIBC2 or KXIO2 menu entry for details. 
TUN PWR 
NOR 
If set to NOR, TUNE power level follows the POWER knob. Otherwise, the 
parameter sets a fixed power level (0-10 W) for TUNE, overriding the present 
POWER knob setting.  
Note: TUN PWR does not pertain to ATU TUNE, which uses 2 or 3 W (KXAT2) 
or 5 W (KXAT100).  
TX BIAS 
 
ppp   qqq 
Transmit bias constants. See Transmit Bias, pg. 39. 
TX CMP 
0 
Transmit speech compression (SSB mode). A setting of 20 (dB) is a good 
compromise between SSB signal talk power (“punch”) and good fidelity. Set to 0  
(default) when doing 2-tone IMD testing. Note: TX CMP is automatically set to 0 
in audio data modes (DATA A and AFSK A). 
TXCRNUL 
 
1   nnnn 
Used at the factory to null the transmit carrier on each band. See pg. 40. 
TX DLY 
 
NOR 005 
Varies the delay in milliseconds between key-down and RF output. This is useful 
with external power amplifiers having slow T/R relays. (Use NOR with the 
KXPA100 if there is no following higher-power amplifier.) There are two TX DLY 
settings: one for HF-10 m and the other for transverter bands. NOR (5 ms) is 

============================================================
PAGE 52
============================================================

52 
recommended in most cases. A delay of up to 20 ms can be set, but use the 
smallest delay possible since longer delays can add some timing variation in CW 
mode at higher code speeds. 
TX EQ 
 
+0 dB, 
each band 
Transmit audio graphic equalizer (applies to voice modes only). Functions the 
same as RX EQ, above. TX EQ can be adjusted during transmit.  
  Do not use high settings of TX EQ without carefully monitoring your 
signal. Most microphones, including the Elecraft MH3, will provide good 
audio quality with little or no TX EQ. High settings can cause distortion. 
TX GAIN 
 
 ALC   nn 
Shows whether transmit ALC (automatic level control) is enabled, along with the 
transmit gain constant for the present band (nn). The gain constant is updated 
whenever the TUNE function is used at exactly 6.0 W and SWR is 2.0:1 or lower. 
See Transmit Gain calibration procedure, pg. 39. 
If a KXPA100 amplifier is connected via the remote-control cable, PA MODE is 
ON, and PWR is 10 W or higher, the TX GAIN parameter shows the KX2 drive 
level for 75 W output at the KXPA100. If the drive value is preceded by the letter 
‘A’, it was obtained from the KXPA100 (factory calibration value). If the drive 
value is preceded by the letter ‘t’, it was obtained by doing P out CAL at 75 W at 
the KX2 itself (see MENU:PA MODE). Holding CLR will erase the KX2’s CAL 
value on the present band, restoring the ‘A’ value (from the KXPA100). 
This menu entry is also used to turn transmit ALC  on/off. It can be turned off for 
transmit testing purposes by tapping ATU while in this menu entry. (This is NOT 
necessary for any operational purpose. In all modes, ALC is optimized for low 
distortion.) When ALC is turned off, a (-) sign is added to the parameter, e.g.           
-ALC  nn. Also, an asterisk is added to the PWR control value when it is being 
adjusted (e.g. 5.0 W*). With ALC off, the displayed power level will not change; 
the control functions as a fine power adjustment, and its effect must be observed 
with an external instrument. 
TX GATE  
OFF  0 
The TX noise gate can be used to suppress transmitted audio below a certain level, 
e.g. that of an amplifier fan. Tap 1 within the TX GATE menu entry to turn the 
noise gate on/off. Use VFO A to set the desired threshold. Since there’s no visual 
indication that transmit audio is below the threshold, you should adjust it using the 

============================================================
PAGE 53
============================================================

53 
transmit voice monitor (MON), ideally while using headphones. Set the threshold 
high enough to cut off transmit audio due to local noise, but not so high that it 
causes your voice to drop out too frequently. 
TXSBNUL 
 
GAIN nnn 
Set at factory to null transmit opposite sideband. See pg. 40. 
VFO CRS 
Per-mode 
Tuning rate selection for VFO A and B when coarse tuning is selected (using 
RATE). Also applies to offset tuning of VFO A (via the OFS/B knob) when both 
RIT and XIT are turned off. 
VOX DLY 
0.00 (CW)  
 
0.50 
(voice/data) 
If VOX MD is set to ON in the current mode, this menu entry sets the VOX delay 
time in seconds (recovery time from transmit to receive). In CW mode, the default 
delay (0.00) also turns on the QSK icon, indicating the fastest possible break-in. 
(See CW WGHT menu entry for additional QSK settings.)  
Independent VOX delay times are saved in voice and audio data modes (pg. 28). 
VOX GN 
030 
Adjusts sensitivity of VOX to match your mic and voice. Set to trigger at normal 
speech level, but not in response to noise. Start with low settings (10-20). 
VOX INH 
000 
Adjusts immunity of the VOX circuit to false triggering by speaker audio. (Also 
known as anti-vox.) A setting of about 30 is a good starting point. If receive audio 
from a speaker trips the vox, increase the setting. 
VOX MD 
ON (CW)   
 
OFF 
(voice, AF 
data) 
If VOX is OFF, transmit must be started by tapping XMIT  (otherwise known as 
PTT, or push-to-talk operation).  
In CW mode, setting VOX MD to ON allows “hit-the-key” transmit. In voice 
modes, VOX=ON allows transmit to start when you start speaking. In audio data 
modes, VOX starts transmit when a computer connected to the mic jack outputs an 
audio signal. VOX is always ON in PSK-D and FSK-D modes; PTT is not 
available. 
VOX cannot be used with the built-in microphone.  
WATTMTR 
 
1.00 
Wattmeter calibration parameter. If an external, known-accurate wattmeter reads 
lower than the KX2’s wattmeter, decrease the parameter value (and vice-versa). 
Internal wattmeter accuracy may vary by up to +/- 1 dB, per band. 
On transverter bands, the menu entry name changes to WMTR XV. 
XIT 
OFF 
XIT is short for Xmit Incremental Tuning. Set to ON to offset the transmit 

============================================================
PAGE 54
============================================================

54 
frequency without affecting the receive frequency. The XIT icon will turn on. Use 
OFS/B to set the offset (+/- 9.999 kHz). This is also the offset that will be used 
with RIT (pg. 16). If you use XIT frequently, you may wish to access it via PFn. 
XIT can be useful for applying a small offset to your transmit signal to improve 
copy by other stations, especially in PSK-D mode (such an offset must be 
determined experimentally). It can also be used as an alternative to SPLIT, leaving 
VFO B free for other purposes. For more on XIT and RIT, see pg. 16. 
XVn ON  
 
NO 
Tap 1 – 7 to select the applicable transverter band display (1 - 7). Set parameter to 
YES to enable or NO to disable. 
XVn RF 
 
144 
Lower edge for transverter band <n> (1-7); 0-24999 MHz. (Tap 1 – 7 to select 
applicable transverter band.) 
XVn IF 
 
28 
Specify KX2 band to use as the I.F. for transverter band <n> (1-7). (Tap 1 – 7 to 
select the transverter band.) I.F. selections include 7, 14, 21, and 28 MHz.  
XVn PWR 
 
H 0.1 
Sets upper limit on power level in watts for XVTR band <n>. Tap 1 – 7 to select 
band. Note: The KX2 does not have a low-level transverter port, so transverters 
must have their own T/R switching and be able to handle the specified power level. 
XVn OFS 
 
0.00 
Offset (–9.99 to +9.99 kHz) for transverter band n (1-7). (Tap 1 – 7 to select 
band.) Compensates for oscillator/multiplier chain errors in external transverters.

Troubleshooting 
The most common symptoms and their causes are listed below, in three categories (general, transmit,  and receive). 
Most problems are related to control settings. If the problem persists, please contact Elecraft support (see pg. 71) or 
post a question on our email forum.  
General  
§ 
MCU LD shown on LCD, and TX LED flashing: Do a forced firmware load (pg. 34). 
§ 
*****  shown on LCD permanently:  This may indicate that the KX2 did not power-down correctly. 
Disconnect power for a few seconds, then try a forced firmware load (pg. 34). 
§ 
Display backlight turns on, but then turns off upon release of switches: Disconnect all external equipment 
from the KX2. Verify power supply or battery voltage is between 8 and 15 V. 
§ 
ERR nnn (error) message appears in the VFO B area: Refer to Error Messages (pg. 60). 
§ 
Scrolling message appears in the VFO B area: Refer to Scrolling Alert Messages (pg. 63). 
§ 
PA FLT (power amplifier fault) message appears in the VFO B area:  See KXPA100 owner’s manual. 
§ 
BAT LOW is flashed periodically: Check the battery voltage (tap DISP and rotate OFS/B until the supply 
voltage display appears). If the batteries are at their normal voltage, you may have MENU:BAT MIN set to the 
wrong low-battery warning level. See this menu entry for recommendations. 
§ 
Can’t turn power on: Check the power cable. If running from an internal battery, make sure it’s charged.  
§ 
Can’t turn power off: If the display remains on, or the unit is otherwise unresponsive, disconnect the power 
supply. (If an internal battery pack is in use, also remove the battery.) Allow 5-10 seconds, then reconnect 
power and try turning the unit on. 
§ 
General problem with transmit and/or receive: Many problems can be caused by low power supply voltage 
or by a noisy or intermittent supply. Check your power supply’s on/off switch, voltage, fuses (if applicable), 
and DC cabling. The KX2 provides both voltage and current monitoring (pg. 23). Also see Transmit and 
Receive troubleshooting sections, below. 
§ 
General problem with firmware behavior: (1) Check all menu settings (see menu listings in the previous 
section). Hold MENU for about 3 seconds to see help information about each menu entry. (2) Try loading the 
latest KX2 firmware. Review the release notes for changes that may be related to your symptoms. 
§ 
N/A message (Not Applicable): The function you’re trying to use does not apply in the present context. 
§ 
Mode icon flashes: This is a reminder that you’re about to set the KX2 up for cross-mode SPLIT operation 
(VFOs in different modes). Tap any key to clear. To view and change VFO B’s mode, tap A / B. 

============================================================
PAGE 56
============================================================

56 
§ 
VFO A frequency doesn’t change:  You may have the VFO locked. Tap RATE to unlock. 
§ 
VFO A frequency changes by itself:  If using a mic other than the MH3, set MIC BTN to OFF.  
Transmit 
§ 
BND END: Indicates an attempt to transmit outside the ham bands. 
§ 
TX LED on all the time: This could indicate that PTT is being held on by external equipment. Try 
disconnecting everything connected to the left side panel except the power supply. VOX gain (VOX GN menu 
entry) may be set too high. 
§ 
HI CUR or HI SWR warning: Check supply voltage. If voltage is low and/or a low-impedance antenna 
load is present, current can go up for a given requested power level. Reduce power if necessary. (The KX2 may 
do this automatically. If this doesn’t reduce the current or reflected power to safe levels, the KX2 will drop out 
of transmit mode.) 
§ 
HI TEMP warning: PA heat sink temperature has exceeded the safe operating limit. Use DISP to check 
power supply voltage, current drain, and PA temperature. Allow heat sink to cool. Reduce power if necessary. 
(The KX2 may automatically reduce power, drop out of transmit mode, or turn itself off.)  
§ 
KX2’s right side panel is hot to the touch: The right side is used as a heat sink, so it it normal for it to feel 
quite warm during long transmissions. The panel will run cooler if you use shorter transmissions, lower power, 
or a lower supply voltage. If operating in sunlight, try to orient the right side panel away from the sun. Third-
party heat sinks are available that may allow for higher power and/or higher duty cycyle use. 
§ 
ATU fails to find a match: If the ATU is unable to find a match, even after tapping  ATU  twice within 5 
seconds, the speaker magnet may be interfering with one of the ATU module’s relays. Contact Elecraft for a 
possible solution (replacement speaker or a thin, self-adhesive shield). 
§ 
An asterisk (*) appears in the PWR setting display (e.g. 5.0 W*): Transmit ALC has been turned off. To 
turn it back on, go to MENU:TX GAIN , unlock the parameter by holding FREQ for 3 seconds, then tap ATU 
This will turn off the (-) sign in front of ALC.  
§ 
Can’t transmit in CW mode: (1) Make sure the key or keyer paddle is plugged into the correct jack. (2) To 
transmit immediately upon hitting the key, you must have VOX-CW enabled (see MENU:VOX). If VOX is off 
(PTT-CW), you must tap XMIT before sending; otherwise only a sidetone is generated . (3) You may be in 
SPLIT mode, with VFO B set for a voice or data mode. Tap A/B to check VFO B’s mode. 
§ 
Can’t use the mic in voice modes: You may be in SPLIT mode, with VFO B set for CW or data mode rather 
than a voice mode. Tap A/B to check VFO B’s mode. 
§ 
Low power output:  You may also be working into a high-SWR load and/or using a low supply voltage. Also 
try redoing Transmit Gain calibration (pg. 39). Note:  Max power also varies per band. 

============================================================
PAGE 57
============================================================

57 
§ 
Inadequate transmit carrier or opposite-sideband suppression: The voice- and audio-data carrier and 
opposite sideband will typically be down 60 dB or more at 5 watts output.  If either is significantly higher than 
this level, the Transmit Carrier or Transmit Opposite Sideband calibration steps (pg. 40) can be performed. 
These procedures require a spectrum analyzer and are normally done only at the factory. 
Receive 
§ 
HI RFI warning, preamp turns off, or RX icon turns on:  The KX2 protects itself from high received signal 
levels. First the preamp is turned off, if it was on. The second step taken by the KX2, if necessary, is to turn on 
the RF attenuator. The receive overload icon (RX), near the ANT icon, will turn on. Once signals return to a 
safe level for 5 seconds, the attenuator will be turned back off. Also see COR (next item). 
§ 
Carrier-operated relay activated (a relay is heard, and the RX icon turns on): The carrier-operated-relay 
(COR) may be activated due to the signal from a nearby transmitter. This is usually due to close proximity 
between your antenna and the other station’s antenna. The COR is actually the relay for the present low-pass 
filter. When the relay opens, signals will drop by 40 to 60 dB, protecting the KX2. The relay will close again 
shortly after the signal drops. If the COR is being repeatedly activated, try moving the antennas farther apart. 
You can also increase the COR threshold, at your discretion; see MENU:COR LVL. 
§ 
HI CUR warning:  May indicate that speaker volume is too high; gain is reduced by the KX2 in this case.  
§ 
No received signal: Check (1) antenna connectors; (2) RF gain too low (set RF gain menu entry fully 
clockwise, to –0 dB); (3) bandwidth too narrow (tap FIL and rotate AF GAIN/MON to widen the passband); 
(4) MENU:REF CAL parameter not adjusted properly. 
§ 
Signals very weak below 3 MHz:  The KX2 is designed primarily for use on 80-10 meters (3 to 30 MHz). 
Receive capability extends down to 500 kHz, but as shown in the Specifications section, signals will be 
progressively attenuated below 3 MHz due to high-pass filtering in the T/R switch. (This filtering is intended to 
protect the T/R switch PIN diodes.) Attenuation will be approximately 15-20 dB in the 160-meter band, and 
much greater at the low end of the AM broadcast band. Sensitivity should still be adequate for reception of 
strong AM broadcast stations, useful in an emergency. Also see next item regarding mixer images in this range. 
§ 
Signals in the 500 kHz-3 MHz range appear to be off-frequency: These may be mixer images of signals 
higher up in frequency. They appear because the KX2 does not provide filtering below 3 MHz (see above). 
Generally, if an AM broadcast signal in the 550-1700 kHz range can be tuned in at an exact multiple of 10 kHz 
in LSB or USB mode, then it is a legitimate signal. Those tuning in at non-multiples of 10 kHz are likely to be 
images. 

============================================================

§ 
Received signal level too low: (1) check headphone and speaker plugs and cables; (2) make sure that 
MENU:RX EQ has not been set for large cuts; (3) verify that MENU:REF CAL is properly adjusted; (4) make 
sure MENU:RF GAIN is set to -0 dB. 
§ 
Spurious signals (“birdies”):  All receivers exhibit some birdies. Most will be inaudible with an antenna 
connected. In the KX2, there may be significant birdies or harmonics of birdies at the following frequencies 
due to internal signal sources: 16000 and 18432 +/- 5 kHz (MCU and DSP clock frequencies), 500-900 kHz 
(DC-DC converter oscillators, CMOS RF switches). In the unlikely event that a birdie interferes with operation, 
try CW reverse (MENU:ALT MD), or auto-notch (APF-AN switch, SSB mode only). 
§ 
Opposite-sideband images heard: Opposite-sideband suppression is typically 50-60 dB. If images appear too 
high in amplitude, Receive Opposite Sideband suppression may have to be adjusted (normally done at the 
factory; see pg. 39). 
§ 
 “Frying pan” or buzzing sound in headphones:  Headphones may not be plugged in all the way. 
§ 
Mobile installation noise: If the 12 V DC accessory jack in a vehicle causes interference to the KX2’s 
receiver, improve filtering of the DC supply.  
§ 
Low-level signals are heard that don’t change as the VFO is rotated: It’s possible for extremely strong 
signals to create audible artifacts, due to AM detection at the mixer, that are not affected by tuning the VFO. If 
this occurs, first try turning off the preamp. If that doesn’t suffice, turn on the attenuator. If the source of such 
signals is a nearby transmitter (such as at Field Day), reorient or move antennas, or use an external band-pass 
filter. 
§ 
KX2 VFO signal is heard in a nearby receiver: A receiver whose antenna is in very close proximity to the 
KX2’s may pick up the KX2’s VFO signal when both are set to about the same frequency (+/- 8 kHz). Try 
separating or reorienting the antennas. If that isn’t possible, try turning on the preamp and/or attenuator at each 
radio. This will often improve isolation between the local oscillator and the antenna jack. 
§ 
Internal speaker distortion at high volume: The KX2’s small internal speaker is not intended for use in high-
noise environments, such as in a noisy vehicle or outdoors in high winds. If audible artifacts occur, reduce AF 
gain or switch to headphones or an external speaker. (Stereo headphones or dual external speakers will allow 
the use of audio effects and dual watch.)

Parameter Initialization (EEINIT) 
  Parameter initialization should not be done without first consulting Elecraft customer support. We can 
help you solve most problems without taking this step. Also, please look for your symptoms in the 
Troubleshooting section above.  
It is possible, though rare, for EEPROM parameters to become altered in such a way as to prevent the firmware 
from running correctly. If you suspect this, you can reinitialize parameters to defaults, then restore a previously-
saved configuration (or re-do configuration steps manually; no test equipment is required). To initialize: 
§ 
IMPORTANT:   Run the KX2 Utility program and use the Save Configuration function to save your present 
firmware configuration. (Otherwise, you’ll need to re-do calibration steps after EEINIT.) 
§ 
Turn the KX2 off (using the KX2’s on/off switch combination, not your power supply). 
§ 
Hold in the NB knob with your left hand. Then turn power on with your right hand by holding RATE and A/B 
together for about 3 seconds until the LEDs all turn on. Finally, release the NB knob after a few more seconds. 
You should see EE INIT on the LCD. 
§ 
When EE INIT completes, you may see ERR nnn due to initialization. Tap DISP to clear any error 
messages. 
§ 
Restore all parameters using the Restore Configuration function of the KX2 Utility program. Then turn power 
off and on again. See if the original problem has been resolved. If not, contact Elecraft. Note: Elecraft 
maintains configuration files for all KX2s sold. Your original configuration file can be sent to you via email on 
request.

Error Messages (ERR nnn) 
Error messages may be displayed on VFO B at power-up or during normal operation. In many cases error messages 
are due to a problem with a single option module or incorrect firmware configuration. See Error Message table 
below for details on specific ERR messages and associated data values, if any. 
  Some error conditions suggest doing an EEINIT if other remedies fail. DO NOT DO AN EEINIT unless 
you have consulted Elecraft customer support. 
If you see an error message on VFO B (ERR nnn): Write down the error message, as well as any associated 
error data shown on the VFO A display (e.g. d=005). Then tap any switch to clear the error code. Multiple errors 
may occur; in this case, write down each of the messages and VFO A data, if any, before you clear them.

Scrolling Alert Messages  
Certain conditions will result in an alert message scrolling across the VFO B display. These are listed below. 
 
Alert  Message 
Description 
CONNECT DATA IN TO MIC JACK    
In AF data modes (DATA-A, AFSK-A), an external audio 
source must be plugged into the mic jack. This disconnects 
the internal mic. 
NO MON WITH INT MIC+INT SPKR    
If the internal mic and internal speaker are both in use, voice 
monitoring (MON) is disabled to prevent audio feedback. 
NR REQUIRES AGC MD ON   
NR (noise reduction) cannot be used with AGC turned off. It 
also does not apply in DATA mode. 
TAP 3 TO TURN OFF TX ALC 
The TX GAIN menu parameter (per-band gain constant) is 
normally set automatically during TX gain calibration. The 
parameter can be adjusted manually (not recommended), but 
TX ALC must be turned off first. 
TAP XMIT TO SET BIAS    
When aligning TX BIAS, it is only necessary to tap XMIT. 
This alert appears if the user attempts to manually adjust the 
parameter using VFO A. 
TO UNLOCK, HOLD FREQ FOR 3 SEC   
The current menu parameter cannot be adjusted until it is 
unlocked by holding the FREQ switch for ~3 seconds. 
USE FSK-D, OR SSB WITH 2-TONE ON    TX sideband nulling (MENU:TXSBNUL) requires that 
MENU:2 TONE be set to ON, and that the KX2 be in SSB or 
FSK-D mode. 
USE PHONES 
DUAL RX (dual watch) cannot be used with the internal 
speaker. Phones or dual external speakers are required, since 
the audio associated with VFO A is routed to the left channel, 
and VFO B to the right.

Theory Of Operation 
This section includes a functional description of the KX2’s RF, control panel (CP), and option boards; a block 
diagram; and a glossary of selected technical terms. Also see the KX2 FAQ (www.elecraft.com). 
RF Board 
The RF board contains all of the KX2’s RF circuitry as well as low-level baseband (AF) stages in the receive path.  
The relay-switched low pass filters are used during both transmit and receive. The signal on the antenna side of the 
filters pass through a forward/reflected power and SWR bridge to the antenna jack (BNC), or to the optional 
KXAT2 automatic antenna tuner.  Latching relays are used to minimize power consumption. Transmit/receive 
(T/R) switching splits the common signal path from the antenna and low pass filters to either the transmitter power 
amp or receiver input. T/R switching uses PIN diodes and CMOS switches for clean, silent transitions. 
The RF band-pass filters are used for both transmit and receive. Filters are selected with PIN diodes.  The band 
pass filters significantly attenuate receive signals at harmonics of the RX frequency, particularly the odd harmonics. 
Following the band pass filters and T/R switching are the RF preamplifier and an attenuator.  These provide 
various tradeoffs between overall receive gain and noise figure (or MDS). 
The RX mixer converts the RF signal to quadrature (8 kHz IF I and Q signals), which are low-pass filtered and 
amplified before being passed to the CP board for analog to digital conversion (ADC).   
The TX AF Amp and TX mixer block converts baseband (AF I and Q) modulating signals to an RF signal which 
is then routed to the T/R switching and band pass filters.  This signal provides excitation to the 10 W power 
amplifier (PA). The PA uses a pair of RF power MOSFETs.  Temperature monitoring of the MOSFETS allows 
automatic reduction of power if they become too hot during long transmit periods. 
The optional KXAT2 automatic antenna tuner (ATU) option connects between the BNC antenna jack and the RF 
board’s SWR/power bridge and low pass filters. It uses a latching relay-switched “L network” with seven inductors 
and seven capacitors capable of matching a wide range of antenna impedances. The KXIO2 and KXIBC2 options 
incorporate a real-time clock (RTC) function, useful for logging and time-keeping. The KXIBC2’s primary 
function is to recharge the internal Li-ion battery pack (KXBT2).  

============================================================
PAGE 65
============================================================

65 
Control Panel (CP) Board 
The CP (Control Panel) circuit board contains all of the KX2’s control circuitry as well as IF and AF stages for the 
transmit and receive paths.  It contains two on-board microcontrollers: one to manage the radio (MCU), and another 
to process all transmit and receive signals digitally (DSP).  
The synthesized, digitally controlled local oscillator (LO) provides quadrature signals to the transmit and receive 
mixers. 
The DSP is a 32-bit, floating-point device.  All modulation, demodulation, AGC, filtering, equalizing, and other 
signal processing functions are handled by this IC.  
The incoming IF signal from the RF board is provided in low-level phase quadrature, or In-phase and Quadrature 
(I/Q). These signals are digitized by a very low power, high-performance analog-to-digital converter (ADC), then 
passed to the DSP for processing. 
The baseband transmit signal is likewise provided in I/Q format to the RF board.  A dedicated, high-performance 
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is used to generate a very clean transmitted signal. 
DSP program storage is by means of a 2 megabyte FLASH memory device.  This IC also provides storage of 
operator messages for the DVR function. 
Stereo (two-channel) audio from the DSP is converted to analog signals for use with headphones or dual external 
speakers (PHONES jack).  The use of stereo allows special processing to help reduce operator fatigue (audio 
effects), and also optimizes dual watch capability, where the signals from VFOs A and B are routed to the left and 
right audio channels. If the internal speaker is used, the audio is monophonic, and is boosted by a separate speaker 
amplifier IC. Microphone audio (or low level audio from a computer or or other source) uses another ADC that 
runs at all times to enable voice-operated transmit (VOX) operation. 
The microcontroller unit (MCU) handles all user interface functions for the KX2, including 12 switches and 4 
shaft encoders. It also handles timing, sequencing, and overall management of the radio. The MCU uses EEPROM 
to store operator preferences, messages, and settings. An accessory port (ACC) provides a serial I/O interface 
between the MCU and an attached personal computer (PC), with both RS232 and USB cabling options.  
The MCU uses two industry-standard serial protocols to control circuitry on the CP and RF boards. I2C 
(pronounced I-squared-C) controls the synthesizer IC. An SPI bus handles bandswitching, changeover between 
receive and transmit, etc. The driver for the liquid-crystal display (LCD) is also controlled via the I2C port.

Glossary of Selected Terms 
The following terms are often used in the discussion of amateur radio transceivers and related equipment. All are 
applicable to the KX2, used here to illustrate some of the concepts. Also see the ARRL Handbook. 
________________ 
A-to-D or ADC (analog-to-digital converter): An integrated circuit that converts analog signals such as audio or 
RF into digital form. Digital signals can then be processed by a digital signal processor, or DSP (see below). 
AF, RF, and IF: AF stands for audio frequencies—usually, sounds that you can hear. RF, or radio frequencies, are 
the actual frequencies of the radio signals (or TV, or cell phone, etc.). IF, or intermediate frequencies, are generally 
somewhere between RF and AF. In a receiver, it is usually advantageous to convert RF signals to a lower IF at 
which is it more practical to obtain gain or selectivity. These IF signals are then further converted to AF and 
amplified further so they can be used to drive headphones or speakers. 
Attenuator: A circuit that reduces signals to a safe level for use by subsequent stages in a receiver or transmitter. 
The KX2’s receiver includes a switchable attenuator (pg. 17). 
ATU (automatic antenna tuner): A device inserted between a transmitter (or transceiver) and an antenna that 
establishes an optimal match between the two, thus allowing full power transfer. (See KXAT2, pg, 33.) 
D-to-A or DAC (digital-to-analog converter): An integrated circuit that converts digital signals into analog form, 
such as audio or RF. Also see DSP, below. 
dB (decibel): A measure of signal increase or decrease, or of one signal relative to another signal. In human terms, 
one dB represents a “just noticeable difference” between two signals. Mathematically, dB is derived from the 
logarithm of the ratio of two signals. Receivers must handle signals over a huge range—in excess of 100 dB. dBm 
is a more specific term that means “dB relative to 1 milliwatt” (1 mW) of power. 1 mW is thus “0 dBm.” 
DC-to-DC converter: A device that converts one DC voltage into another. For example, the KX2 includes a very 
efficient DC-to-DC converter that converts 12 V (nominal) at the DC input jack to 3.3 V for use by its low-voltage 
circuitry. The advantage of a DC-DC converter is that when it steps voltage down, it steps current up (or vice-
versa). In this case, the 300 mA the KX2 consumes at 3.3 V might require only 100 mA at the 12 V power source.  
DSP (digital signal processor): A highly specialized numeric computer, implemented on a single integrated 
circuit, that processes signals digitally. Inputs to the DSP must generally be converted from analog to digital form 
(see A-to-D, above), while outputs from the DSP must be converted from digital to analog (see D-to-A). Use of DSP 

============================================================
PAGE 68
============================================================

68 
techniques can result in greater versatility and smaller size compared to the equivalent analog circuitry. The KX2 
uses a very advanced, power-efficient DSP. 
ESD (electrostatic discharge): An event during which high voltages or currents appear within a radio or other 
electronic device, potentially causing damage. Antennas, control cables, or the operator’s body are all potential 
ESD sources. Damage can be avoided through proper handling and grounding techniques. 
HF (high-frequency): Signals in the range of 3 to 30 MHz. In amateur radio, HF is usually shorthand for 160-10 
meters (1.8 to 29.7 MHz), or the “HF bands.” 160 meters actually falls in the MF range (0.3 to 3 MHz). 
IMD (intermodulation distortion): Unwanted signal products that are created in the various stages of a receiver or 
transmitter. If all stages were entirely “clean,” there would be no IMD. In reality, every stage contributes some 
distortion, with the amount of distortion being proportional to signal level. Radio designers go to great lengths to 
minimize distortion, trading off circuit cost and complexity against the benefit of reduced interference.  
Keyer: A device that partially automates the sending of Morse code, allowing for faster code speeds. The KX2 has 
a built-in keyer function, as well as an optional attached keyer paddle (KXPD2 or KXPD3, pg. 33). 
MCU (microcontroller unit): A computer or controller usually integrated onto a single integrated circuit. A 
modern amateur transceiver usually has one main MCU that controls most radio functions. It may have other 
smaller MCUs or co-processors that perform specific functions. The DSP in the KX2 is a specialized co-processor 
(see DSP, above). 
MDS (minimum discernable signal): A measure of a radio’s sensitivity, expressed in dB (decibels) relative to 1 
milliwatt (0 dBm). For example, the user of a KX2 with the 20 dB preamp turned on, can typically copy a CW 
signal at about -137 dBm, or 137 dB below 1 milliwatt. MDS is dependent on the receiver bandwidth, with 500 Hz 
normally used for standardized measurements. 
Preamp: A pre-amplifier that increases RF signals to a higher level for use by subsequent stages in a receiver. A 
preamp is generally designed to contribute little noise of its own, so that it improves the noise figure of the radio 
(also see MDS). 
SDR (software-defined radio): A radio that performs signal modulation, demodulation, filtering, and other 
functions in software. Such software can execute internally (in a dedicated DSP IC, as in the Elecraft K3S, KX3, or 
KX2) or externally (in a general-purpose computer, as required with “black box” SDRs). 
VFO (variable frequency oscillator): A signal source used to select a radio’s operating frequency. The KX2’s 
large knob controls VFO A, while a smaller knob controls VFO B (see Using VFOs A and B, pg. 16).

TRANSMITTER* 
Output Power 
Maximum PWR control setting:  80-20 meters, 15 W; 17-10 meters, 12 W.      
Maximum levels may not be achievable under all conditions. Settings above 12 W 
should be used with caution and at light duty cycle (e.g., “hunt/pounce” operation). 
Also see NOTE below. 
Specified Output Power (with 13.8 V power supply):  80-17 meters, at least 10 W PEP 
max (+/- 1 dB); 12 and 10 meters, at least 8 W PEP max (+/- 1 dB).  
NOTE:  Maximum available output power varies with power supply voltage, antenna 
load impedance, and PA temperature. If power output does not match the requested 
PWR setting, it should be reduced for safety purposes. Operation above 10 W requires 
higher supply voltage (typically 13 V). When using over 5 W in SSB, AM, DATA-A 
and AFSK-A modes, the recommended supply voltage is 12 V or higher to minimize 
transmit intermodulation products.  
Internal ATU (KXAT2) 
7 L/7 C network; matching range typ. 20:1 or higher. Rated power: 15 W.            
Insertion loss (bypass mode):  < 0.5 dB. Two different data sets available for 
home/field use (see MENU:ATU DATA). 
Transmit Features 
Adjustable speech compression (baseband envelope clipping); 8-band TX EQ; VOX; 
full and semi CW break-in with adjustable delay; diode T/R Switching; 3 DATA/CW 
messages and 2 voice (DVR) messages; automatic logging of DATA/CW text (see 
MENU:LOGGING). 
Carrier Suppression 
> 50 dB typ. 
Harmonic / Spurious Outputs 
> 50 dB below carrier typ. @ 10 W 
CW Sidetone/Transmit offset 
400-800 Hz, adjustable (receive filter center frequency tracks sidetone pitch) 
 
 
* Specifications apply only within ham bands except as noted. All measurements taken with 13.8 VDC supply.

Elecraft 1-Year Limited Warranty 
 
This warranty is effective as of the date of first consumer purchase (or if shipped from the factory, the date the product is 
shipped to the customer). It covers both our kits and fully assembled products. For kits, before requesting warranty 
service, you should fully complete the assembly, carefully following all instructions in the manual. 
 
Who is covered:  This warranty covers the original owner of the Elecraft product as disclosed to Elecraft at the time of 
order. Elecraft products transferred by the purchaser to a third party, either by sale, gift, or other method, who is not 
disclosed to Elecraft at the time of original order, are not covered by this warranty. If the Elecraft product is being bought 
indirectly for a third party, the third party’s name and address must be provided at time of order to ensure warranty 
coverage. 
 
What is covered:  During the first year after date of purchase, Elecraft will replace defective or missing parts free of 
charge (post-paid). We will also correct any malfunction to kits or assembled units caused by defective parts and 
materials. Purchaser pays inbound shipping to us for warranty repair; we pay shipping to return the repaired equipment to 
you by UPS ground service or equivalent to the continental USA and Canada. For Alaska, Hawaii, and other destinations 
outside the U.S. and Canada, actual return shipping cost is paid by the owner. 
 
What is not covered: This warranty does not cover correction of kit assembly errors. It also does not cover 
misalignment; repair of damage caused by misuse, negligence, battery leakage or corrosion, or builder modifications; or 
any performance malfunctions involving non-Elecraft accessory equipment. The use of acid-core solder, water-soluble 
flux solder, or any corrosive or conductive flux or solvent will void this warranty in its entirety. Also not covered is 
reimbursement for loss of use, inconvenience, customer assembly or alignment time, or cost of unauthorized service. 
 
Limitation of incidental or consequential damages: This warranty does not extend to non-Elecraft equipment or 
components used in conjunction with our products. Any such repair or replacement is the responsibility of the customer. 
Elecraft will not be liable for any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited to any 
loss of business or profits.
