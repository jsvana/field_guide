Introduction
The Elecraft KX1 is a compact, multi-band CW transceiver 
optimized for backpacking and travel use. With internal battery, 
internal automatic antenna tuner, log-book lamp, and plug-in keyer 
paddle, it offers a high level of integration. 
Unlike most transceivers, the KX1’s controls are located on the top 
of the cabinet, and the keyer paddle attaches at the front. This “trail-
friendly” format is ideal for hand-held or lap-top operation, e.g. 
when sitting on the ground, using a camp chair, reclining, or even 
standing. The KX1 is also at home on a table or desk, providing an 
optimal display viewing angle without the need for a tilt stand. The 
unique plug-in keyer paddle is both physically reversible for right- or 
left-handed use. 
The transceiver covers the full 40 and 20 meter bands, and optionally 
80 and 30 meters. The VFO is based on a DDS (direct digital 
synthesis) IC, so it can also tune well outside each band, covering 
many popular SWL band segments. A variable bandwidth crystal 
filter permits reception of SSB and AM as well as CW, facilitating 
cross-mode contacts and broadcast reception.  
The KX1’s internal six-cell battery pack can be changed in seconds 
with the removal of two thumb screws. The battery provides 1 to 2 
watts power output, which represents a good tradeoff between 
battery life and communications efficiency. An external 12 V supply 
increases output to about 4 watts. Low receive-mode current drain 
(35 mA typ.) results in battery life of 20 hours or more. The low-
battery warning threshold can be adjusted to match the battery type 
used. 
The KX1 uses a 3-digit LED display that is physically rugged and 
extremely efficient. It requires just 1 to 2 milliamps total current in 
moderate lighting conditions, and about 10 mA at its brightest setting. 
The operator can optionally configure the display to turn off 5 to 60 
seconds after any front-panel control has been used. Operation without 
the display is possible if the CW feedback feature is turned on (audio 
Morse code). This provides audible announcement for the VFO dial, 
menu text, and all controls. 
Additional operating features include instant band selection, nine 
frequency memories, three VFO tuning rates, receive incremental tuning 
(RIT), USB/LSB receive on all bands, and an S-meter display mode. 
The built-in keyer offers Iambic modes A and B and two message 
buffers. In an emergency, two of the front panel switches can be 
configured for use as a manual key or keyer paddle. 
Despite its compact size and many built-in accessories, the KX1 is easy 
to build. The basic unit consists of a single printed circuit board, with no 
surface mount components to install (the three surface mount parts used 
are pre-installed). Assembly and test are completed in phases to simplify 
any needed troubleshooting, and only a few alignment steps are 
required. 
We’d like to thank you for choosing the KX1 transceiver, and hope it 
meets your expectations for ultra-lightweight portable operation.

Preparation for Assembly  
 
Overview of the KX1 
 
The KX1 chassis consists of a top and bottom cover (Figure 1). All 
components, including controls and connectors, are mounted on a 
single printed circuit board (PCB). Only three surface-mount 
components are required, and these are pre-mounted to the board.   
The top cover is also the front panel. The controls face upward for 
convenient operation. The printed circuit board mounts directly behind 
the front panel.  
The automatic antenna tuner option (KXAT1) plugs into the bottom of 
the main PC board at J6, J7 and J8. The optional keyer paddle 
(KXPD1) plugs into the Keyer/Paddle jack, J3, at the front edge of the 
top cover. 
The bottom cover is held in place by two thumbscrews. Two three-cell 
AA battery sockets are attached to the bottom cover and are wired in 
series to form a six-cell pack. The battery voltage is 7.2 or 9 V 
depending on the battery type. 
Appendix D provides close-up views of the top and bottom of the 
assembled PC board.

Unpacking and Inventory
Preventing Electro-Static Discharge Damage 
Problems caused by Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) may be very 
difficult to troubleshoot because damaged components may still 
operate somewhat rather than fail completely. We strongly recommend 
you take the following anti-static precautions (listed in order of 
importance) to avoid trouble: 
 
Leave ESD-sensitive parts in their anti-static packaging until 
you install them. The packaging may be a special plastic bag 
or the component’s leads may be inserted in conductive foam. 
Parts which are especially ESD-sensitive are identified in the 
parts list and in the assembly procedures.  
 
Wear a conductive wrist strap with a series 1 megohm 
resistor. If you do not have a wrist strap, touch a ground 
briefly before touching any sensitive parts to discharge your 
body. Do this frequently while you are working. You can 
collect a destructive static charge on your body just sitting at 
the work bench.  DO NOT attach a ground directly to 
yourself as this poses a serious shock hazard. 
 
Make sure your soldering iron is ESD-safe and has a 
grounded tip 
 
Use a grounded anti-static mat on your work bench.  
 
Inventory 
We recommend that you do a complete inventory, using the parts lists 
in Appendix A.  
i
 DO NOT HANDLE PARTS OR CIRCUIT BOARDS 
WITHOUT ANTI-STATIC PROTECTION (see Preventing 
Electro-Static Discharge Damage above).  Do not remove the black 
foam from the leads of any parts. This foam is further protection 
against static damage.  
Many components are inside small envelopes and bags. Open them 
one at a time, and return all of the parts to the envelope before opening 
another. Be careful to avoid mixing parts and putting them in the 
wrong bags or envelopes.

Identifying Common Resistors and RF Chokes
The color bands that indicate the value of each resistor are shown in 
the text to help you identify each part. However, it's helpful to 
familiarize yourself with the color code. The color-code chart (see 
Figure 2) shows how to read the four color bands on 5% resistors. For 
example, a 1,500 ohm (1.5 k) 5% resistor has color bands BROWN, 
GREEN, RED and GOLD. 
1% resistors are similar, but use five bands: three significant digits, a 
multiplier instead of a gold or silver tolerance band, and a fifth and to 
indicate the tolerance. Since the bands usually fill the length of the 
resistor body, the fifth band is wider to indicate that the value should 
be read starting at the other end.  
For example, the first four bands on a 1.50 k, 1% resistor are 
BROWN, GREEN, BLACK, BROWN. The multiplier value is 1 
rather than 2 in this case because of the third significant digit.  
If in doubt about a resistor’s value, use a DMM. It may be difficult to 
see the colors on some resistors. Do not be concerned with minor 
deviations of your DMM reading from the expected value. Typical 
errors on most DMMs and the tolerances of the resistors normally 
produce readings that are slightly different from the value indicated by 
the color bands. 
RF chokes and other small molded inductors look very much like short 
resistors. They have color bands that represent the same numeric 
values as resistors but because the inductors are short, it may not be 
obvious how to read them. In general the multiplier or tolerance bands 
are closer to the end than the first digit, just the opposite of the way a 
resistor. On small inductors the color bands may be centered on the 
body. 
If you sort out the inductors before starting assembly, you will be able 
to positively identify each inductor from the color bands listed in the 
Parts List.

Identifying Resistor Packs
Resistor packs combine a number of resistors in one component with 
multiple leads. They may be in-line packages with 6 or 10 leads in a 
row or they may be in 16-pin dual in-line pin (DIP) packages similar 
to many integrated circuits.  
Like integrated circuits, pin 1 of each component is identified by a dot 
near it. Some resistor packs are symmetrical. That is, they can be 
installed either way. However, some are not. ALWAYS follow the 
instructions and orient the resistor pack exactly described in the 
procedure. 
The value of the resistor pack is indicated in the last three digits shown 
on the package. The numbering scheme is similar to capacitors. The 
first two digits indicate the first and second most significant digits and 
the third digit is a multiplier. For example, “...391” indicates 390 ohms 
and “...104” indicates 100,000 ohms (100K). 
Identifying Capacitors 
Capacitors are identified by their value and the spacing of their leads. 
Small-value fixed capacitors are usually marked with one, two, or 
three digits and no decimal point. If one or two digits are used, that is 
the value in picofarads (pF). If there are three digits, the third digit is a 
multiplier. For example, a capacitor marked "151" would be 150 pF 
(15 with a multiplier of 101). Similarly, "330" would be 33 pF, and 
"102" would be 1000 pF (or .001 µF). Exceptions are described 
specifically in the text and parts list.  
Fixed capacitors with values of 1000 pF or higher often use a decimal 
point in the value, such as .001, .047, or 2.2. This is the value in 
microfarads (µF). (1 µF is equal to 1,000,000 pF.) 
The lead spacing is noted in the Parts Lists for most capacitors. If two 
different types of capacitors have the same lead spacing will indicate 
which one to use. When lead spacing is important, both the value and 
the lead spacing is shown in the assembly procedure. For example, 
“LS 0.1” means that the lead spacing is 0.1 inch (2.5 mm). 
Identifying Toroid Cores 
Several toroidal inductors are used in the KX1. It is important to use 
the correct type of core. This can be determined from the color and 
size. Two types of cores are used in the KX1: Iron powder cores and 
ferrite cores. If you mix them up, your KX1 will not operate properly.  
The iron powder cores used are type T37-6. The T identifies an iron-
powder core. The number following the T specifies the outside 
diameter in hundredths of an inch, in this case 0.37 inches (9.4 mm). 
The suffix (-6) refers to a specific mix of iron powder. You cannot tell 
what mix of iron power is used by looking at the core, so they are 
painted with specific colors. The -6 cores are painted yellow. 
Ferrite cores are indicated in the parts list by the letters FT in the part 
number. The KX1 uses FT37-6 cores. Like the iron powder cores, the 
37 refers to the outside diameter. The -46 identifies the type of ferrite 
used. These cores are not painted. They are dark grey.

Tools
You will need the following tools to build this kit: 
 
Fine-tip temperature-controlled ESD-safe soldering station 
with 700 to 800F tip (370-430C). Recommend a spade tip 
approx. 0.05” (1.3 mm) wide. Do not use a high-wattage iron 
or soldering gun since this can damage pads, traces, or the 
parts themselves.  
 
IC-grade, small-diameter (.031”) solder (Kester #44 or 
equivalent). 
i
 DO NOT use acid-core solder, water-soluble flux solder, 
additional flux or solvents of any kind. Use of any of these will 
void your warranty.  
 
Desoldering tools and supplies are invaluable if you make any 
modifications or need to do any repairs. Narrow solder wick or 
a good vacuum desoldering tool such as the Soldapullt® 
model DS017LS are recommended. See Soldering and 
Desoldering, on page 11 for more information.  
 
Screwdrivers: A small #2 Phillips, a small flat-blade for 
slotted screws and a very small flat-blade (about 0.1 in or 2.5 
mm wide) with an insulated handle to adjust the trimmer caps. 
 
Needle-nose pliers. 
 
Small-point diagonal cutters. Flush-cutting type is required 
(Xcelite MS54-5J or equivalent).  
 
Digital Multimeter (DMM) for voltage checks and confirming 
resistor values. A DMM with capacitance measurement 
capability is desirable, but not required.  
 
50-ohm dummy load capable of handling 5 watts, minimum.  
 
Magnifying glass or visor.  
We strongly recommend that you use a conductive wrist strap and 
anti-static mat during assembly. These items are available at very low 
cost from Jameco, Mouser, and other electronics suppliers.

recommendations.

Soldering and Desoldering
i
  Use adequate ventilation when soldering; avoid 
inhaling smoke or fumes. Always wash your hands after 
handling solder, as lead residue is highly toxic.  
Solder Recommendations 
We recommend small-diameter (.02 to .03") rosin-core solder, similar 
to Kester type 44. Solder with 2% silver is used by some builders and 
will work equally well.  
If you use a minimum of solder, there will be no need to clean PC 
boards. The use of acid-core solder, water-soluble flux solder, or any 
corrosive or conductive flux or solvent is likely to damage components 
and/or PC boards. 
Soldering 
When applying solder, use the minimum amount required to surround 
the component lead and make good contact with its printed-circuit pad. 
You don't need a "fillet" (build-up) of solder.  
To provide a good connection, the solder must flow onto both the 
component lead and its PC board pad. To ensure that both will be 
heated at the same time, the tip of the iron should contact both the 
component lead and the PC board pad before solder is applied. 
 
Solder joints should be clean and shiny. If a joint appears dull or has 
fine cracks, it is probably cold. Cold solder joints should be cleaned 
and re-soldered. First, use solder wick (desoldering braid) to remove 
the old solder. Then apply fresh solder. If you have many cold solder 
joints, it probably indicates that your soldering iron temperature is too 
low, or that the tip or solder itself is defective.  
New soldering iron tips must be tinned before they’re used. Allow the 
iron to warm up completely, then apply solder and allow it to coat the 
entire tip. After a few minutes, wipe off the excess solder. Use a 
sponge for wiping the iron tip, and clean the sponge often.

    ELECRAFT 
Desoldering
The printed circuit boards used in the kit are double-sided, meaning 
that they have circuitry on both sides. The component mounting holes 
are plated-through to complete electrical connections between the two 
sides.  
Removing components from double-sided boards can be difficult, 
since you must get all of the solder back out of the hole before a lead 
can be removed. To do this, you'll need solder wick (desoldering 
braid) and/or a vacuum desoldering tool. It also takes some practice. A 
number of suggestions are provided below. 
The best strategy for avoiding de-soldering is to place all 
components properly the first time. Double-check values and 
orientations, and avoid damaging parts via ESD. 
When removing components: 
 
Don't pull a lead or pin out of a hole unless the solder has been 
removed, or you are applying heat. Otherwise, you can literally 
pull out the plating on the plated-through hole. 
 
Limit soldering iron contact to a few seconds at a time. 
 
Use small-size solder-wick, about 0.1" or 2.5 mm wide. Use the 
wick on both the top and bottom pads when possible. This helps 
get all of the solder out of the hole. 
 
If you use a vacuum desoldering tool (solder sucker), use a large 
unit. Small solder suckers are not very effective. 
 
The safest way to remove ICs and other components with more 
than 3 leads is to clip all of the pins at the body of the device first, 
then remove all of the pins individually. You may damage pads 
and traces by trying to remove such components intact. 
 
Invest in a PC board vice with a heavy base if possible. This 
makes parts removal easier because it frees up both hands. 
If in doubt about a particular repair, ask for advice from Elecraft or 
from someone else with PCB repair experience.

 Do not skip any steps. You may adversely affect both the 
performance and appearance of the kit by using the wrong 
assembly order. 
Installing Parts 
Follow the instructions carefully about the position of parts. Many 
parts must be positioned exactly as instructed or they may strike the 
case or other components when the KX1 is assembled. 
The value and corresponding color codes are shown for all resistors 
and inductors that may have them. In some cases the value may be 
stamped on the component instead of the color code.  
Before beginning assembly, you should review the photographs in 
Appendix D to see what the completed PC boards look like. You'll 
also find front and back views of each PC board in the Parts Placement 
Drawings, Appendix F.  
IC Sockets 
Only one integrated circuit is mounted in a socket. Do not use a 
different type of socket. The one supplied is a low-profile socket that 
provides just enough room for the case to fit together.  
Do not use sockets on any ICs other than the one provided. Mount the 
other ICs directly on the board as instructed. Sockets will not allow the 
cover to close. Also sockets in RF may cause improper circuit 
operation due to increased lead inductance and capacitance.

Assembly - Part I
In Part I, the control, display, and audio stages will be assembled and 
tested. Later sections cover receiver (Part II) and transmitter (Part III) 
assembly and test. 
i
 BEFORE YOU START: 
1. WEAR A GROUNDED WRIST STRAP or ground 
yourself briefly before touching components. You can 
discharge static by frequently touching an unpainted, 
grounded metal surface.  
2. WEAR EYE PROTECTION before trimming any leads. 
3. WASH YOUR HANDS after handling solder. Solder is a 
toxic substance.  
4. PROVIDE VENTILATION and avoid inhaling the fumes 
produced by soldering.  
 If you haven’t done so already, open the bag of components 
labeled KX1 MAIN BAG and sort the parts into groups. Many of the 
components will be in small paper envelopes. Do not mingle the 
contents of one envelope with another. As you are instructed to locate 
particular components, use the photographs in the KX1 PCB parts list 
in Appendix A to help identify them.  
i
 The components pre-installed on the circuit board are 
extremely static-sensitive. Wear a wrist strap or ground yourself 
before handling the board.  
 Position the circuit board on your bench so that KX1 is visible in 
the upper left corner. This is the side of the board that will be directly 
under the front panel when the transceiver is completed. This side will 
be referred to the as the top face of the board throughout the assembly 
procedure. Components will be installed on both sides of the board. 
 Turn the circuit board over so the bottom is facing up and orient 
it so the outline for J1 is in the upper right corner. Find the outline for 
resistor R8 next to the outline for J1.

 Bend the leads of resistor R8, 6.8k (blu-gry-red), 1/4 watt, at 
right angles close to the body. Insert the leads in the solder pad holes, 
and bend them out on a 45-degree angle on the opposite side of the 
board to hold the resistor in place.  
i
  Components MUST be tight against the board or the case 
may not close properly during final assembly. This is especially 
true of components on the bottom of the board where there is very 
little clearance between the board and the battery packs.  
 Check the position of the resistor to ensure it is centered in the 
printed outline and flush against the board as shown in Figure 3.

 Locate the printed outline for R28 on the back of the board. It is 
about 3/4” (2 cm) down from the top edge near the center. 
 Bend the leads of resistor R28, 1.8k (brn-gry-red), 1/4 watt, to fit 
in the holes indicated on the board. Note that the leads should NOT be 
bent close to the body of the resistor like you did for R8. Fit the leads 
so the body of the resistor sits against the board within the outline, 
then bend them outward at about a 45 degree angle to hold the resistor 
in place. 
 Solder the leads to R28 and trim them flush with the board.  
i
  From this point forward, instructions to “install” a 
component mean to position it within its outline against the board, 
solder, and trim the leads flush on the opposite side.  
Locate the two 200 ohm (red-blk-brn)1/8 watt fixed resistors, R6 
and R7. They are about half the size of the 1/4 watt resistors you just 
installed.  
Install the 1/8 watt resistors in the spaces shown just to the left of 
R8 near the top of the board: 
_ 
R6, 200 ohms (red-blk-brn), 1/8 watt.  
_ 
R7, 200 ohms (red-blk-brn), 1/8 watt.

  Save the longer clipped component leads. Several of them 
will be needed for grounding wires and a jumper. 
Install the following 1/4 watt resistors on the bottom side of the 
board. Their locations are in the lower right quadrant of the board 
when it is oriented the so outline for J1 is in the upper right corner.

Turn the board over (top face up) and orient it so that the KX1 
lettering is in the upper left corner and the notch is on the lower edge.  
Install the following 1/4 watt resistors about 3/4” (2 cm) to the left 
of the notch and about 3/4” (2 cm) up from the lower edge of the 
board: 
_ 
R12, 6.8k (blu-gry-red). 
_ 
R13, 22k (red-red-org). 
Locate resistor pack RP5, 100 k ohm (104). RP5 is a ten-pin in-
line package whose number on the side ends in “104” (see Figure 4).  
If you are in doubt about the value, use your DMM to verify that the 
resistance between adjacent pins is 100k ohms. Note the dot at one end 
indicating pin 1. 
 
Figure 4. Installing Resistor Packs. 
Find the outline for RP5 on the top of the circuit board. With the 
board face up so that KX1 is in the upper left corner, the outline for 
RP5 is just to the left and above the notch at the center of the lower 
edge of the board.

Insert RP5 with Pin 1 of the pack in the round solder pad.  The 
round pad is farthest from the edge of the board.  
i
  Be careful to orient the resistor packs so the dot next to 
Pin 1 on the pack is at the round solder pad on the board. Once 
soldered in place, it is almost impossible to remove the pack 
without destroying it. 
Wet your soldering iron with a small amount of solder, and touch 
it to one of the pins to tack-solder it in place.  
Check the position of RP5 to verify that the pins at both ends are 
inserted as far as they will go into the board as shown in Figure 4, then 
solder and trim all ten leads.  
Follow the same procedure to install six-pin resistor pack RP2, 1K 
(102) above and to the left of RP5. Pin 1 goes at the top pointing 
toward the printed outline for C51.  
Install ten-pin resistor pack RP4, 10k (103) below U2 in the top 
left quadrant of the board. Pin 1 goes to the left, pointing toward the 
outline for RP3.  
Install ten-pin resistor pack RP3, 10k (103) to the left of RP4. Pin 
1 of RP3 is at the top, nearest the end of RP4.  
Locate resistor pack RP1, 390 ohms (391). RP1 is in a 16-pin DIP 
package that looks much like an integrated circuit. The resistance 
elements run across the package (e.g. pin 1 connects to 9 through 390 
ohms).  
Test fit RP1 between RP2 and RP3 and just below the outline for 
DS1 on the circuit board. It is normal for the pins of a DIP package to 
be slightly flared so they do not easily fit into the solder pad holes. If 
necessary, place RP1 so that an entire row of pins is against a smooth 
surface and straighten the pins as shown in

Turn the board face up so KX1 is in the upper left corner. Locate 
the printed outlines for diodes D2 and D3 near the center of the left 
edge of the board.  
Locate diodes D2 and D3 (1N5817). Note that there is a band on 
one end of the diode body.

  All diodes MUST be installed with the banded end of the 
diode over the band on the circuit board.  
Install the following diodes:

With the board face up (KX1 in the upper left corner) position the 
28-pin socket in the space provided for U1 in the lower left quadrant 
of the board. The outline has (SOCKET) inside of it.  
i
 DO NOT TRIM the 28-pin socket pins before or after 
soldering. These pins are hollow and form the lower part of the 
socket for the IC pins.  
i
 Do not substitute a different socket for the one provided. 
The very low profile of the supplied socket is required for the case 
to fit together during final assembly.  
Orient the socket so the notch at one end is toward the left edge of 
the board, aligned with the notch in the printed outline.  
Hold the socket against the circuit board and tack-solder pins at 
opposite corners of the socket.  
i
  Do not overheat the socket pins. Too much heat will melt 
the plastic socket. Use only enough solder to make a good joint. 
Check to ensure that the socket is pressed against the circuit board 
at both ends. If necessary, reheat the pins at each end and press down 
on the socket so it rests directly against the board.  
Solder all 28 pins. Double-check your work and inspect each pin. 
Use a magnifier if necessary. If a pin is missed or poorly soldered, it 
may make contact during initial testing, but become intermittent later. 
Such intermittents can be very difficult to troubleshoot. Remember; 
do not trim the socket pins!

below that height limit but, if necessary, gently straighten the leads 
using long nosed pliers so it will sit closer to the board and meet the 
height requirement.  While forming the leads, do not tug on them. 
Squeeze and bend the leads with your pliers to straighten them. 
Slight chipping of the epoxy around the leads will not harm the

Locate electrolytic capacitor C38 (10 µF, 35 v) and inspect the 
leads. One lead should be shorter than the other. The capacitor body 
will have a stripe and a minus sign (—) above the shorter lead.  
Locate the printed outline for C38 to the left of RP3 on the top 
face of the circuit board. Note that there are two solder pads for the 
capacitor leads: one is round and one is square. A plus (+) symbol is 
printed next to the square pad.

Insert electrolytic capacitor C38 (10 µF, 35 v) with the longer lead 
passing through the square solder pad with the (+) symbol next to it 
and the shorter lead through the round pad. Bend the leads to hold the 
capacitor in place against the board.   
Be sure that the capacitor is tight against the board and solder the 
leads. Use a ruler to verify that the top of the capacitor is no more than 
5/16” (7.9 mm) above the board (see Figure 8). After soldering, trim 
the leads flush with the bottom of the board.  
i
  All electrolytic capacitors MUST be installed with their 
leads oriented to observe the polarity markings as described 
above.  
Install electrolytic capacitor C10 (10 µF, 35 v) below resistor R13 
at the bottom edge of the board. Observe the proper polarity as you 
did for C38 above, and be sure the capacitor is no higher than 
5/16” (7.9 mm) above the board.  
Turn the board over so the bottom face is up and the outline for J1 
is in the upper right corner.  
Install electrolytic capacitor C7 (220 µF, 25 v) at the center of the 
board near resistor R28. Be sure to observe the proper polarity as 
you did above. Save one of the clipped leads to use in the following 
steps.  
Turn the board over so the top face is up and test-fit the low-
profile crystal in the space provided for X1 near the bottom edge 
below the socket for U1. The crystal may be installed either way. 
Note: The holes in the solder pads for X1 may be larger than necessary 
to fit the leads. This is normal. It is to accommodate different styles of 
leads on the crystals supplied with some kits.  
i
  Do NOT use more solder than necessary on the leads for 
X1. Too much solder will wick through the holes and may cause a 
short to the case of X1 underneath the crystal. The short is 
impossible to see or correct without removing the crystal.  
Spread X1’s leads as necessary to hold the crystal against the 
board and solder one lead. Do not hold your iron on the lead more 
than 2 or 3 seconds, maximum. Too much heat will ruin the 
crystal.  
Check to ensure that X1 is sitting directly against the board. If 
necessary, reheat the soldered lead while pressing down on the crystal.  
Solder the second lead to X1 and trim the leads flush.

Use a discarded component lead to ground the case of the crystal 
as follows: 
_ 
Solder one end of the lead in the ground hole near the edge of 
the board to on the left side of the crystal.  
_ 
Tin the top of the crystal nearest the lead with a small amount 
of solder. Keep the soldering time to 3 seconds or less to 
avoid overheating the crystal. Allow the crystal to cool if you 
need to apply heat more than once. It often helps to tin the 
case more quickly if you lightly scrape the metal with a knife 
or a screwdriver blade first.

Alignment and Test - Part I
In this section you’ll become familiar with basic KX1 operation, while 
testing the control and display functions. 
i
 Microcontroller U1 is extremely static-sensitive. Wear a 
wrist strap or ground yourself before handling U1. 
Remove microcontroller U1 from its conductive foam packing 
and inspect the pins. The two rows of pins must be straight and 
parallel to each other to establish the proper pin spacing for insertion 
into the socket. If necessary, straighten the pins as shown in Figure 5.  
Identify the end of the IC where Pin 1 is located. It will have a 
notch, a dimple or both at this end (see Figure 11).  
i
 When U1 is pressed into its socket, you must be careful to 
avoid jamming its pins. Make sure all the pins are lined up with 
the associated holes before pressing down on the IC. Watch the 
pins on both rows as you press down to be sure each pin goes 
straight down into its socket hole and does not bend in under the 
IC or outward alongside the socket. Realign each pin individually 
with its socket hole, if necessary. 
Insert microcontroller U1 in its socket with pin 1 or the notched 
end lined up with the notched end of the socket (the end closest to the 
edge of the board). 
Press down very firmly on U1. If it is not seated as far as 
possible into its socket, the pins may not make good contact. 
Temporarily mount the VFO knob on the shaft of encoder Z1. 
Align the set screw with the flat side of the encoder shaft and tighten it 
using the Allen wrench supplied.  
i
 You may notice some side play in the encoder shaft. This is 
normal in miniature shaft encoders with an integral pushbutton 
switch. 
Set slide switches S1 and S2 to the OFF position.  
Connect an 8 to 14 VDC power supply to J1 with the positive (+) 
lead to the center pin. A mating connector for J1 is supplied with the 
kit. If you use a power supply voltage of less than about 10.5 volts, 
you may see a  BAT LO message flashed on the LED during initial 
tests. This is because the BAT menu parameter is set to 10.0 volts by 
default. You can set the BAT parameter to a lower value to eliminate 
the warning message. 
 Unwrap the cover and set it near the circuit board so you can see 
the legends identifying the switches and their functions. 
i
  If any test or alignment step fails, refer to the 
Troubleshooting section (Appendix E).

LED Tests 
i
  When testing the lamp in the following step, do NOT look 
directly at the white LED. It is very bright.  
Switch S1 (LAMP) On and verify that D1 lights, then turn it Off.  
Switch S2 (POWER) On. If you see or smell smoke, or a 
component feels hot to the touch, switch S2 Off and disconnect the 
power source immediately. Locate the source of trouble before 
proceeding.  
You should now see either E10 or 00.0 on the 3-digit LED 
display. E10 is an informational code that indicates that the EEPROM 
(configuration memory) on the microcontroller has been initialized to 
default values. This message will appear only once, and can be cleared 
by tapping any of the three pushbutton switches. 00.0 is a portion of 
the VFO frequency, which is set to 7100.00 kHz the first time you turn 
power on. The display format will be described  in a later step. 
i
  After a few seconds, the display turns off automatically if 
you haven’t touched the VFO knob or pressed any switches. This 
is intended to extend battery life. Moving the VFO knob or operating 
one of the pushbutton switches will turn it on again. (The display time-
out is programmable. This will be discussed in the next section.) 
Voltage Checks 
Connect your DMM’s (-) probe to circuit board ground at the 
screw hole next to capacitor C6. Use the (+) probe to check the 
following DC voltages: 
_ 
U1, pin 1: 5±0.25 Vdc 
_ 
U3 pin 6: 6±0.25 Vdc 
_ 
D2 anode: Supply voltage. 
_ 
D2 cathode (banded end): supply voltage – 0.3 Vdc (approx).  
Leave your DMM’s (-) probe connected to the circuit board 
ground, and set your DMM for a 200 to 300 millivolt AC range. 
Check the AC voltage at the following pins. A higher voltage than 
shown may indicate a problem with one of the voltage regulators as 
explained in the note below. 
_ 
D2 anode: < 20 mV AC rms. 
_ 
D2 cathode (banded end): <20 mV AC rms. 
_ 
U1 pin 1: <20 mV AC rms. 
_ 
U3 pin 6: <20 mV AC rms.  
 
i
  The 2.7 V and 6 V regulators used in the KX1 (U7 and U9, 
respectively) are low-dropout types, which may oscillate if their 
bypass capacitors are defective or are of the wrong value. If you 
see high AC voltage at any of the points indicated above, verify 
that electrolytic capacitors C7, C10, and C38 are installed in the 
correct orientation and that their leads are properly soldered. If 
they are, you may be seeing a false AC voltage indication due to 
noise or probe leakage; re-test using a different DMM.

The Tap/Hold Rule 
Each of the push-button switches on the front panel has two functions, 
one activated by a TAP (short press) and the other activated by a 
HOLD (long press, about 1/2 second). The upper label on each switch 
shows the TAP function (white lettering), and the lower label shows 
the HOLD function (yellow lettering). To highlight this in the text, we 
use two different typographical styles to identify switches: TAP and 
HOLD. 
 
Accessing the Configuration Menu 
Tap MENU  to enter the KX1’s configuration menu. You should 
see LED on the display, which is the first menu entry (display 
brightness setting and timeout period). Try rotating the VFO knob, 
which scrolls through all 16 menu entries.  
 Use the knob to return to the LED  menu entry. Then hold  
EDIT to change the LED parameter. The display will change to L 
followed by a number from 0 to 6.   
 Tap BAND and RIT  to change the display brightness. Settings of 
2 or 3 are about right for indoor daytime use, 0 and 1 are suitable in 
low lighting, and 5 or 6 in bright lighting.2  
 Rotate the VFO knob to select the desired LED timeout (5 to 60 
seconds or INF for infinite, i.e. never times out. As you rotate the 
knob, the timeout period is flashed, e.g. t10 for 10 seconds. (Note: 
When the LED times out, it will go blank. However, in very low 
lighting or darkness, you may see a slight residual illumination.) 
 Tap MENU once to return to menu scroll mode, then tap it again 
to return to the frequency display. 
                                                     
2 CW feedback on switch-press can be used in lieu of the display. This is 
described in the Operation section. 
Frequency Display and Band Change 
The display shows three digits of the operating frequency. Which three 
digits are shown depends on which tuning rate you’ve selected: 1 kHz, 
100 Hz (default), or 10 Hz. At 7100.00 kHz, the three tuning rates 
produce the following displays: 
     7100.00 
     7100.00      7100.00 
 To select 1 kHz steps, press and hold the VFO knob (from now 
on, we’ll indicate this as:  hold 1 kHz). Then try rotating the knob. No 
decimal point is displayed at this step size. 
 To select 10 Hz or 100 Hz steps, tap the VFO knob (i.e., tap  
10/100 Hz). The tuning rate alternates between 10 and 100 Hz steps 
as you tap, and the decimal point moves accordingly. 
 You can check the MHz and kHz digits at any time by tapping 
BAND . For example, if the VFO frequency is 7100.00 kHz, tapping 
BAND will first show 7 , then 100, then return to the appropriate 
display for your selected tuning rate.  
 To change bands, tap  BAND  twice, quickly. This will trigger the 
MHz-kHz display, in this case showing 14 then 100 (14100.00 kHz). 
(Tapping or double-tapping BAND also stores the present frequency 
for the next power-up or band change.) 
Set the POWER switch to OFF. 
Disconnect the power source from J1.  
Remove the VFO knob and set it aside for reinstallation later.  
Wrap the cover and put it in a safe place until it is needed. 
i
  Leave microcontroller U1 in its socket during the 
remainder of the assembly process. Be sure to observe ESD 
handling precautions at all times.

  In the next step you will install a diode which must be 
oriented in the proper direction. Be certain to align the banded 
end of the diode over the band on the circuit board.  
Install diode D4 (1N4148) on the lower edge of the board to the 
right of L9.  
Install varactor D5 (1SV149) as follows. When you are finished 
the top of the varactor must no be more than 5/16” (7.9 mm) above the 
board.  
_ 
Locate the outline for D5 on the board. It is near the center of 
the board immediately to the right of resistor pack RP5.  
_ 
Orient the varactor according to the printed outline on the 
board. The varactor may have a beveled back instead of a 
rounded back as shown on the board (See Figure 10).  
_ 
Insert the varactor leads in the solder pad holes. The varactor 
has a third lead that has been clipped close to the body. Space 
the varactor up off of the board slightly to ensure this lead 
does not short to the board.   
_ 
Solder one lead, then check to ensure that the top of the 
varactor is no more than 5/16” (7.9 mm) above the board. If 
necessary, reheat the joint while adjusting the height of the 
varactor.

Locate C45, 68 pF (68 or 680), LS 0.2. Be sure that you do not 
confuse this capacitor with C56, also 68 pF but with 0.1” lead spacing, 
that has not been installed yet. Note: C45 may be a much larger disc 
type, which would not fit in the location for C56. But if both are small, 
you’ll need to go by the lead spacing. 
Install capacitor C45 to the left of C46 in the upper right quadrant 
of the board.  
Install capacitor C26, 120 pF (121) pillow-style disc ceramic, 
about 1/2” (1.3 cm) below C45. Be careful not to put this capacitor 
in the space for C44. When C26 is installed, the space for C44 
between C26 and C45 should be empty. 
 Test fit capacitor C1, 4.7 pF (4.7) pillow-style disc ceramic, next 
to the lower right corner of the encoder. The bottom of the round 
capacitor body should touch the board. If the ceramic coating on the 
leads runs down too far to allow it to sit against the board, remove the 
excess by squeezing the coating with long-nose pliers. It will crumble 
and can be scraped away from the lead.  
 Install capacitor C1, 4.7 pF (4.7) making sure the bottom of the 
round body is touching the board.  
i
  The following capacitors must be mounted closer to the 
board than the others. They are installed in the area that lies 
beneath the optional KXB30 30 meter or KXB3080 30 and 80 
meter module. The KXB30 or KXB3080 module will not fit if these 
capacitors sit too high above the board.   
The capacitors installed in this step must be closer to the board 
than any of the previous parts you have installed. After installation, 
these capacitors must not exceed 5/32” (3.9 mm) in height.

Use a ruler to verify that the above capacitors are no higher 
than 5/32” (3.9 mm) above the board.  
 On the bottom of the board, ensure L5 (installed earlier) is 
against the board, or it may strike other components when the KX1 is

pins. If it hasn’t been trimmed already, trim it flush.  
Install the following capacitors so that about 1/16” (1 mm) of lead 
shows between the capacitor and the board, so they can be folded 
down against the board like you did with C39 earlier. DO NOT fold

Install U5 (NE/SA612 or NE/SA602) near L10 and L8 at the 
lower center of the board. Use the same technique you used above. 
i
  In the following step, U6 must be fully seated before 
soldering or it will interfere with the optional KXB30 30 m or 
KXB3080 30 and 80m module. To ensure it is properly seated, a 
different installation method will be used. 
Install U6 (NE/SA612 or NE/SA602) near encoder Z1 at the 
center of the board. Solder just one pin of U6. 
Re-heat the soldered pin of U6 while pressing down on the it from 
the other side. You may hear or feel it settle into a lower position on

Install trimmer CA as follows: 
_ 
Place a red trimmer in the CA position with the flat side of 
the trimmer over the flat side on the printed outline.  
_ 
Press the trimmer down against the board and spread the pins 
to hold it in place. Note that the adjustment for the trimmer is 
not visible from the top. It is accessed from the bottom 
through the hole in the board.  
_ 
Check to ensure the trimmer is sitting directly against the 
board and then solder and trim both pins.  
Install trimmers CB and CC using the same procedure as CA: 
_ 
CB (red) directly below transistor Q7 on the right side of 
encoder Z1. 
_ 
CC (brown) to the right of trimmer CB.  
Bend ceramic capacitor C1 so that it touches the side of trimmer 
CB. This will ensure that it does not interfere with the KXB30 or 
KXB8030 option when it is installed.  
Turn the board over so the bottom is facing up and jack J1 is in 
the upper right corner.  
Open the package for four crystals: X2, X3, X4 and X5. The four 
crystals are identical.  
i
  While installing crystals in the following steps, be careful 
not to flow too much solder onto the leads. Too much solder may 
wick through the plated hole and cause a short to the case under 
the crystal were it cannot be seen.  
Install crystal X2 (4.9136) as follows:  
_ 
Insert X2 (4.9136) into the board over the printed outline just 
below electrolytic capacitor C7. The crystal may go into the 
holes either way around . 
_ 
Note the location of the ground solder pad near the crystal. 
_ 
Remove the crystal and solder to the case a discarded 
component lead no more than 3/16” (4.5 mm) above the 
bottom of the crystal where it will go straight down through 
the ground solder pad. If desired, you may attach the ground 
lead after installing the crystal. 
_ 
Place the crystal on the board, threading the leads through 
the solder pad holes.  
_ 
While holding the crystal vertical and firmly against the 
board, wet your soldering iron with a drop of solder on the 
tip and tack-solder one of the crystal leads.  
_ 
Check to ensure the crystal is flat against the board and 
perpendicular to the board. If necessary, reheat the lead while 
adjusting the position of the crystal.  
_ 
Solder and trim the remaining crystal and ground leads.

  Be certain the jack is mounted on the BOTTOM face of 
the circuit board as shown. It is very difficult to remove this jack 
without damaging the board if it is installed incorrectly.   
 Solder the center pin lead and recheck the alignment.  
 Without disturbing the alignment of the jack, solder one of the 
heavy ground nubs to the board. Then re-check the alignment. Reheat 
the nub, if necessary, to correct any misalignment.

J2, replace it with a fine tip now. 
 Turn the board face up with KX1 in the upper left corner.  
 Fit headphone jack J4 in the printed outline in the lower right 
corner. The jack has six plastic nubs that hold it up off of the board 
slightly. The pins will be flush with the solder pads on the bottom of 
the board.  
 Solder one pin and carefully recheck the position of the jack to 
be sure all the plastic nubs are against the board. If necessary, reheat

Locate the printed outline for R2 next to electrolytic 
capacitor C20 on the right side of the board. This is the 
CENTER of the three outlines.  
_ 
Position R2 (B10K) so the three signal pins and two large 
mounting tabs are in the holes in the board.  
_ 
Press down on the potentiometer until it rests solidly against 
the board on the two metal nubs next to each mounting tab 
and the shaft extends straight up at right angles to the board.  
_ 
Solder one of the smaller pins, then recheck the alignment to 
make sure the pot has not been moved. 
_ 
Solder and trim the remaining small pins.  
_ 
Solder the two large pins using just enough to make a good 
electrical and mechanical joint between the tab and the plated 
hole. Do NOT try to fill the hole with solder.

  In the following steps you’ll wind and install toroidal 
inductors L1 and L2. They must be wound as exactly indicated in 
the instructions or the transceiver will not operate correctly.3 
 Turn the board bottom face up with J1 in the upper right corner. 
Locate the printed outlines for L2 and L1 in the upper left corner near 
J2.  
Locate the four toroid cores. There are two yellow T37-6 cores 
and two dark gray FT37-43 cores. Use the yellow cores to make L1 
and L2.  
i
 Although the yellow and gray cores look similar, they have 
very different electrical properties. You must use the yellow cores 
for L1 and L2. The transceiver will not work if you use the wrong 
cores. See Identifying Toroid Cores, page 9, for more information. 
 Wind L2 first as follows: 
_ 
Cut a 13” (33 cm) length of red enameled wire.  
_ 
“Sew” the long end of the wire through the hole in the core 
for a total of 14 turns as shown in Figure 16. Count one 
“turn” each time the wire passes through the center of the 
core. There are no “half” or “quarter” turns when winding a 
toroid. Match the winding direction shown in the figure or the 
leads won’t line up with the solder pads on the circuit board. 
_ 
Spread the turns around the core so the finished result looks 
like Figure 16.

Strip the insulation and tin the leads of both inductors using one 
of the following techniques: 
1. Heat Stripping:  
a. Place a small amount of solder (a.k.a. a “blob” of solder) 
on your soldering iron. 
b. Insert the clipped end of the wire into the hot solder. If the 
iron is hot enough, you should see the insulation bubble 
and vaporize after 4 to 6 seconds. 
c. Add more solder and feed more wire into the solder as the 
enamel melts. Continue tinning the wire up to the edge of 
the core, and then slowly pull the wire out of the solder. 
d. If any enamel remains on the lead, scrape it away using 
your thumbnail or sharp tool. 
2. Burning: The insulation can be burned off by heating it with a 
butane lighter for a few seconds. Use sandpaper to remove the 
residue, then tin the bare wires.  
3. Scraping: Use a sharp tool to scrape the insulation away. Work 
carefully and gently: do not nick the wire. Work around the 
entire circumference of the wire to remove all of the enamel 
and tin the bare wires.  
Place L2 over the printed outline on the board and thread its leads 
through the solder pads. 
Pull the leads tight so the toroid is sitting upright and against the 
board. Check to see that some tinned lead is visible above the pad near 
the toroid when the wire is pulled tight. If necessary, remove the toroid 
and tin the lead closer to the core. It won’t matter of the tinned wire 
touches the core itself. The toroid core is not a conductor. 
Solder both leads. 
Use your DMM to check for continuity across the solder pads. It 
should be less than 1 ohm. If it is higher, you probably have a poorly 
tinned toroid lead. Sometimes the leads look like they are soldered, but 
because there is a film of enamel still on the lead, it is not making 
contact with the solder pad. If the resistance is greater than 1 ohm, 
remove the toroid, clean and re-tin the leads and reinstall it. 
Wind and install L1 using the same procedure except that L1 has 
13 turns.  Use the second yellow toroid core for L1. 
i
  Do NOT attach L1 or L2 to the circuit board with 
adhesive, varnish, etc. The toroids will be adequately supported by 
their leads. Adhesives or other compounds may damage the 
enamel wire. 
Bend a discarded 1/4-watt resistor lead into a “U” shape and 
insert it into J7 pins 1 and 3 (J7 is the 3-pin connector adjacent to 
antenna jack J1; do not insert the wire into the 2-pin connector, J8). 
This jumper completes the antenna circuit when the optional KXAT1 
ATU is not installed.

 Your kit includes an extra 22 k resistor (red-red-orange) for 
use at R32. This resistor is not present on the Revision B or B1 PC 
boards. It must be soldered in place in the location shown below, 
on the bottom of the board between pins 2 and 3 of U4 (LM386N). 
(It could also be soldered across the pins of C19, nearby, which 
may be easier.) Trim and bend the leads approximately as shown.  
 
 Make sure R32 is pressed flat against the bottom of the 
board. Its leads must not be touching any adjacent pads, traces, or 
components.

Alignment and Test - Part II
Temporarily mount the VFO knob on the shaft of encoder Z1.  
i
  Due to the small size of the KX1’s front panel, knobs are 
not appropriate for use on the RF GAIN, FILTER and AF GAIN 
controls. The shafts of these potentiometers, which are knurled 
and have molded index marks, are designed to function as knobs.  
 Unwrap the cover and set it near the circuit board so you can see 
the legends identifying the controls and their functions.  
 Set AF GAIN fully counter-clockwise (minimum volume). 
 Make sure the POWER switch is turned OFF (S2).  
 Plug your power supply or battery into J1. 
 Turn on power to the KX1. The 3-digit LED display should show 
the operating frequency. If not, disconnect the power source 
immediately. Locate the source of trouble before proceeding. 
 
Relay Test 
 Tap BAND twice, quickly, to change bands. You should hear 
relays K1 and K2 switching. 
 If necessary, use  BAND  again to return to 7 MHz.  
 
Sidetone Generator and Audio Amplifier 
 Plug in a pair of stereo headphones at J4 (at the right end of the 
board), and rotate the AF GAIN control clockwise to about 12 o'clock. 
 Tap MENU and use the VFO knob to locate the STL (sidetone 
level) menu entry. Since you have no antenna connected, you may 
hear some digital switching noise as you rotate the VFO knob or press 
switches. 
 The sidetone level is set by editing the STL menu parameter. 
Hold EDIT to show the parameter and turn on the sidetone. You can 
then rotate the VFO knob to vary the sidetone level, from 0-3. Select 
a comfortable level, then tap MENU to turn off the sidetone and return 
to the STL display.  
Note:  STL sets the sidetone volume level in relation to normal 
received audio. The AF GAIN control sets the overall volume for both 
received signals and sidetone.

pitch can be varied from 500 to 650 Hz using the VFO knob. Select 
the desired pitch, then tap MENU to end parameter edit and return to 
STP. 
 Tap MENU again to return to the normal display. 
 
S-Meter and Voltmeter Displays 
 The DISP function (holding BAND + RIT  together) selects one 
of three display modes. On power-up, frequency display mode will be 
in effect. Hold BAND + RIT to select S-meter mode, which will flash 
a 6-segment bar graph across the upper portion of the display. The 
display may then go blank or show 1 or more segments, since the S-
meter has not been calibrated. (The SIG menu entry is used for this 
purpose; it is described later.) 
 Hold BAND + RIT together again to select voltmeter mode. You 
should see BAT (battery) flash briefly on the LED. Your approximate 
power supply or battery voltage will then be displayed and will flash 
slowly. 
 Return to frequency display mode by holding BAND + RIT  
again. nor (normal) will flash briefly before the frequency is 
displayed. 
Keyer 
Plug a keyer paddle into the key jack (J3). The paddle must have a 
stereo (2 circuit) plug. If you don't have a keyer paddle, you can still 
test the DOT and DASH lines by unscrewing the shell from the 
supplied stereo plug and inserting it in the KEY/PADDLE jack. Use a 
clip lead or a screwdriver to short the tip or ring terminals to the 
ground terminal to trigger dots or dashes. 
 
 Tap MENU and rotate the VFO knob to locate the INP menu 
entry (CW input device selection). Hold EDIT to see the parameter. 
Turning the VFO knob selects HND  (hand key or external keyer),  
PDN  (paddle normal) or  PDR  (paddle reverse). Tap MENU twice 
to return to the VFO display. 
 The keyer speed may be varied from 8 to 50 WPM. Display the 
keyer speed by holding SPEED, then adjust it using the VFO knob. 
Tap any switch to return to the frequency display. (The KX1 does not 
transmit when adjusting the keyer speed.) 
 
 While listening with headphones, test the keyer paddle to verify 
that both dot and dash are working.

Receiver Alignment 
There are two receive band-pass filters to align. The trimmer 
capacitors are adjusted through the bottom of the board as shown in 
Figure 17. The 14 MHz (20 meter) filter has two adjustments, labeled 
20A and 20B on the PC board, while the 7 MHz (40 meter) filter has 
just one, labeled 40.4  
Two additional holes, labeled 30A and 30B, are provided for use with 
the optional 30-meter or 30/80 meter modules (KXB30 or KXB8030).  
The 14 MHz (20 m) trimmers must be aligned first, then the 7 MHz 
(40 m) trimmer, as explained in the following steps.

4 Only one adjustment is required on 40 meters because the first tuned circuit 
is somewhat broadly resonant on this band, allowing the use of a fixed 
capacitor. 
 Set the RF GAIN control fully clockwise. 
 Set the FILTER control fully clockwise. 
 Plug in a pair of headphones or an external speaker, and adjust 
the AF GAIN control until you hear some background noise. If you do 
not hear any noise, refer to Troubleshooting.  
 If the present band is not 14 MHz (20 m), tap BAND twice 
quickly to select it. 
 Set the VFO to about 14100 kHz. Tap BAND if necessary to 
verify that you're in the right 100-kHz segment. 
 Connect an appropriate antenna for the 20-meter band. At 
minimum, connect approximately 15-30 feet (5 to 9 meters) of any 
type of wire to the center conductor BNC connector J2. In general, the 
longer and higher the antenna, the more signal strength that will be 
available during receiver alignment. 
i
  Receiver alignment will be easiest if you use a controlled 
signal, i.e. from a ham-band transmitter, signal generator or noise 
generator. In all cases, use a signal that is weak enough to not activate 
the KX1’s AGC; otherwise, it will be much more difficult to find the 
correct settings for the trimmer capacitors. If you use a transmitter, be 
sure to connect it to a dummy load and operate it at low power.

 Locate a small flat-blade screwdriver or tuning tool for use in 
adjusting the trimmer capacitors. Test the tip of the tool to make sure it 
will through the access holes and can turn the trimmers. If the handle 
is not insulated, wrap the end with tape to prevent your hand 
capacitance from affecting the adjustment.  
i
  The trimmer access holes on the revision B and B1 KX1 
PC boards are plated through and grounded. This may make 
alignment more difficult if you’re using a tool with a long metal 
shaft, rather than a tuning tool with just a metal tip. This is not a 
safety hazard, but you may need to remove the tool after each 
adjustment to check the signal amplitude. (The PC board revision 
letter can be found in the upper left-hand corner of the PC board, 
on the top side.)  
 Tap BAND  twice, quickly, to select the 14-MHz band. 
 While listening to atmospheric noise or a weak CW signal, peak 
trimmer capacitors 20A and 20B. If the peak is not clear, reduce the 
signal input level (the AGC may be getting activated). Do not turn 
the RF GAIN control counter-clockwise, as this will broaden the 
tuning peaks, making them more difficult to identify. 
i
  If you don’t hear band noise or signals, be sure you 
installed the jumper across the outer pins of J7 as described on 
page 41.  
 Tap BAND twice (quickly) to select the 7 MHz band. Set the 
VFO to about 7100 kHz. 
 Switch to an appropriate antenna for this band, if available, or use 
the wire antenna recommended earlier. 
 While listening to noise or a weak signal, peak trimmer 40.  
 
AGC and S-Meter Test 
 Turn the KX1 on and connect an antenna or signal generator. 
 S-meter display mode provides a bar graph to indicate 
approximate received signal strength. To select this mode, hold  
BAND + RIT . You’ll see a brief bar-graph test pattern, then the 
display may go blank or show one or more bars. 
 Tune in a strong signal. (Whenever you move the VFO, the S-
meter bargraph will replaced with the frequency display.) Once the 
signal is tuned in, the AGC should be activated, as indicated by an 
increase in S-meter reading.5 The S-meter zero point and scale can be 
adjusted, if necessary, using the SIG menu entry (page 65). 
i
  Since the KX1 uses audio-derived AGC, the initial code 
element from a very strong station may be heard at a louder 
volume. This is due to the time it takes for the AGC detector 
capacitor, C53, to charge. This effect is lessened somewhat by the 
limiting action of U4 (AF amp), since U4 is operated from a low 
voltage. (See schematic, Appendix B.)  
                                                     
5 Each bar corresponds to roughly two S-units, so that 4 or 5 bars indicates 
about an "S-9" signal.

Receive Current Drain Test (Optional) 
The current drain in receive mode is about 35 mA (with the LED 
menu entry set to 0, 1, or 2). If the current drain is significantly 
lower or higher than this, it could indicate a problem.  
To check the current drain, set your DMM for DC milliamps and 
temporarily insert the DMM in series between the KX1 and the power 
supply.  Turn the KX1 on and note the current: _____ mA. 
 
Operating Frequency Calibration (Optional) 
The operating frequency display may be off by as much as ± 200Hz 
until calibrated, due to variations in the 50-MHz reference oscillator 
and BFO components. Accuracy can be improved to approximately ± 
10 or 20 Hz using the BFO and DDS menu entries. 
While it is possible to do operating frequency calibration at this time, 
we recommend that it be done after assembly and test have been 
completed. The calibration procedure is described on page 68.

 Wind toroidal inductor L3 on one of the FT37-43 cores  
as follows: 
_ 
Cut a 14” (36 cm) length of red enameled wire.  
_ 
“Sew” the long end of the wire through the hole in the core 
for a total of 18 turns. Match the winding direction shown in 
Figure 18. Count one “turn” each time the wire passes 
through the center of the core. There are no “half” or 
“quarter” turns when winding a toroid.  
_ 
Spread the turns around the core so the finished result looks 
like Figure 18. 
_ 
Strip the insulation and tin the leads like you did earlier for 
L1 and L2 (See page 41).  
 Wind toroidal transformer T1 on the remaining FT37-43 core  
as follows: 
_ 
Cut an 8” (20 cm) length of red enameled wire.  
_ 
“Sew” the long end of the wire through the hole in the core 
for a total of 8 turns. Match the winding direction shown in 
Figure 15. Count one “turn” each time the wire passes 
through the center of the core. There are no “half” or 
“quarter” turns when winding a toroid.  
_ 
Spread the turns around the core so the finished result looks 
like Figure 16. 
_ 
Cut a 6” (15 cm) length of green enameled wire.

 Install toroidal transformer T1 first as follows. It will be easier to 
thread all four leads through the proper holes in the board if you install 
it before L3.  
_ 
Thread the leads through the holes in the board. Double 
check to ensure you have the right leads in the right holes 
(see Figure 19). The inductor stands up vertically over the 
printed outline. You will notice that lead 4 cannot be pulled 
tight without dislodging the turns. This is normal. Leave 
enough slack in that lead to avoid disturbing the position of 
the winding.  
_ 
Solder all four leads. 
_ 
Use your DMM to check for continuity between pins 1 and 2, 
then between 3 and 4. The resistance must be less than 1 ohm 
in both cases. If it is higher, you probably have a poorly 
tinned toroid lead. It must be fixed before continuing.

 Check your kit to determine whether a 2SC2166 (metal tab) or a 
2SC5739 (black plastic tab) transistor was supplied. Both transistors 
provide equal performance, but their installation is different because 
the metal tab on the 2SC2166 must be insulated from the mounting 
hardware. Install the transistor exactly as described in the following 
steps.  
 Bend Q6’s leads into a gentle 90-degree curve (see Figure 24). 
Note that the flat side of the transistor faces away from the circuit 
board.  Wrapping the leads around a round screwdriver shaft or drill 
bit helps avoid sharp kinks in the bend. 
 
 
 
 Locate the silk-screened outline for Q6 at the top edge of the 
circuit board. Install the 3/16” (4.76 mm) standoff on the circuit board 
using a 3/16” pan head screw and two split washers as shown in the 
figure.  The split washer under the standoff is important to reach 
the proper height so Q6 will come in contact with the cover. Be 
sure the screw head or washer is not touching the windings on L3 on 
the bottom of the board. They may touch the toroid core in the space 
between the windings. 
 Place Q6’s leads in the holes in the circuit board. Do not solder 
them until instructed to do so.

    ELECRAFT 
 Temporarily secure Q6 to the standoff with a 4-40 flat head 
screw. Tighten the screw enough to hold Q6 securely and parallel to 
the circuit board.  
 Use your long-nose pliers to adjust the leads so the flat side of the 
transistor is parallel to the circuit board. The flat side must face 
AWAY from the board. It will rest against the thermal pad you 
installed in the top cover and must make good contact to transfer heat 
efficiently.  
 Solder the three leads to Q6. Trim them flush on the bottom side 
of the board.  
 Remove the flat head screw holding Q6. If a 2SC2166 is 
installed, the soldered leads should hold the shoulder washer in place. 
 Conduct a thorough visual inspection of the board. Use a 
magnifier. Check especially for the following: 
_ 
Diode D4 is oriented correctly as shown in the Parts 
Placement diagram in Appendix F.  
_ 
All joints soldered with no shorts between solder pads. 
_ 
All components installed. On the bottom are some labeled 
pads that will have no wires in them. They are connection 
points for the optional KXB30 30 meter or KXB3080 80 
meter band module. These pads are labeled “A”, “B”, “C”, 
“D”, “5” and three pads labeled “G”.  
i
  If you installed a 2SC2166 (metal tab) transistor at Q6, 
NEVER install a metal screw in the tab of Q6 when the unit is out 
of its case for testing. The metal tab of Q6 is connected to the + 
side of the power supply and the screw will short the supply to 
ground when power is applied. This may cause serious damage to 
the circuit board or other components. 
 Connect your DMM ground lead to one of the metal stand-offs 
mounted on the board and make the following resistance checks:  
_ 
Q4 Emitter (terminal farthest from edge of board) 20 
to 24 ohms 
_ 
Q4 Base (center terminal) > 10k 
_ 
Q4 Collector (nearest edge of board) > 10k 
_ 
Q5 Emitter (terminal farthest from edge of board) 50 
to 70 ohms 
_ 
Q5 Base (center terminal) > 10k 
_ 
Q6 collector (metal tab if 2SC2166): > 500 ohms 
 Place the three button caps on the pushbutton switches. Press 
down on each cap to snap it in place. 
 Fit the board into the top cover as follows:  
_ 
The control shafts will fit through the holes.  
_ 
If the pushbutton switches don’t line up properly with the 
holes in the cover, use a long tool to reach between the cover 
and the circuit board to nudge the caps into the holes.  
_ 
Finally, you will need to push down gently on the key jack to 
make it snap into its hole in the cover.   
_ 
Check the standoffs at both ends and confirm that they are 
resting against the cover.  
 Secure the board to the cover with three 4-40 x 1/4” flat-head 
screws. Do not over-tighten any of these screws.

 Turn the unit face down on a soft surface and measure the 
resistance between either solder pad for toroid L3 and ground. It 
should be > 500 ohms. If it is less, you must find the cause before 
proceeding. If the metal tab 2SC2166 is installed at Q6, the most likely 
cause will be that the shoulder washer has slipped out or the metal tab 
on the transistor is touching the case  instead of the thermal pad.  
 Install the knob on the encoder shaft.  
 Find the battery holders and inspect the bottom of one. Note the 
ridges and nubs that provide a space for wires under the holder. The 
holder has one wire running between two molded ridges that connect 
the opposite corner cells together.  
 In the following steps you will install and wire the battery 
holders. First, study the wiring drawing in Figure 25. The two holders 
are wired in series. The wires must run against the bottom cover and 
under the holders as shown to avoid interfering with other components 
when the KX1 case is closed.

 Begin by removing the paint from around the holes on the inside 
of the bottom cover where it will attach to the stand-offs on the circuit 
board. There are two holes; one at each end of the cover (see Figure 
25).  
 Select one battery holder and cut the red wire to 3-1/4” (8.3 cm) 
in length. Strip 1/4” (6 mm) of insulation off of the end. These are 
stranded wires. Be careful not to knick or break the strands. Leave the 
black wire its full, original length. 
i
  Repeated insertion and removal of the 2-56 screws used in 
the following steps may result in stripping the threads in the 
bottom cover. To avoid this, study the illustration and instructions 
carefully before inserting the screws. In the event that the 2-56 
screw threads do become stripped, you’ll need to replace the 
supplied screws with longer screws, along with 2-56 hex nuts. 
 Mount this holder in the right hand position as shown in Figure 
25 using two 2-56 screws. Do NOT over-tighten the screws, as this 
may strip the threads.  Be sure the wires exit at the left end as shown.  
 On the second holder, cut the wires as follows: 
_ 
Red: cut to 2-3/4” (7 cm) in length and strip the insulation off 
of 1/4” (6 mm) at the end.  
_ 
Black: cut to 4” (10.2 cm) in length and strip the insulation 
off of 1/4” (6 mm) at the end.  
 Position the second holder on the bottom cover oriented as shown 
and start a screw in the hole nearest the edge of the cover (closest to 
the bottom in Figure 25). Do not tighten this screw yet. Leave it loose 
enough so that the other side of the holder can be lifted up off of the 
cover far enough to slip wires underneath.  
 Slip the three wires shown in Figure 25 under the edge of the 
holder as follows: 
_ 
Position the red wire so it goes under the holder and around 
the nub at the corner.  
_ 
Position the two black wires so the screw will prevent their 
being pulled out from under the holder. Be sure the wires lie 
flat and do not cross over each other under the holder.  
 Insert the remaining screw in the holder and tighten both screws. 
 Wiggle all three wires running under the left battery holder to be 
sure they are not being pinched. You should be able to move the free 
end of the black wire and see it move where it emerges from under the 
holder without interfering with the other wires.  If necessary, loosen or 
remove the top screw and adjust the wires so each one lies flat under 
the holder. Tighten both screws when you are done.   
 Cut a 1” (2.5 cm) length of the black shrink-tubing supplied and 
place it over the end of the red wire on the right hand battery holder.  
 Twist the ends of the red wire from the right holder and the black 
wire from the left holder together to join them. Make the joint small 
and smooth. Solder it.

 Slide the shrink tubing you placed on the red wire over the joint 
and shrink it in place to insulate the connection. You can shrink it 
using hot air from a blow dryer or by simply placing your soldering 
iron very close to the tubing and allowing its radiant heat to shrink it. 
If you place the barrel of a hot soldering iron (the part just behind the 
tip) where it almost touches the tubing and parallel to it, the tubing 
should begin to shrink in about 30 seconds. Repeat at two or three 
places around the tubing to shrink it evenly and snugly.  
 Slide the excess red wire under the right hand holder as shown so 
the splice and wire lies down near the bottom cover. When the unit is 
assembled, the space between the battery holders is taken up by the 
Key jack (J3) and the crystals on the circuit board. 
 Line up the black wire with the red wire in the upper left corner 
that will go to the power plug. Cut the black wire to the same length as 
the red wire and strip 1/4” from the end.  
 Locate the crimp terminals and housing for plug J5 (Figure 26). 
Crimp and solder the terminals to the stripped red and black wires.  
 Insert the terminals into the housing until they latch. Tug on the 
wires to verify that the terminals are locked in place. 
 Double check your installation by attaching J5 to plug P1 and 
verify that the red wire goes to the terminal marked + on the circuit 
board. If you got them backward, press gently with a thin screwdriver 
or knife blade in the slots on the housing to release the terminals.

Alignment and Test - Part III 
 Make sure the KX1 is turned off. 
 Connect a 12 to 14-V, 1-amp power supply (or battery) to J1.  
 Make sure trimmer R4 is fully counter-clockwise (drive level).  
 Connect an antenna that is adequate for receiver testing.  
 Plug in a pair of stereo headphones or a speaker at J2. 
 Turn on the KX1. If the display doesn’t appear, turn the KX1 off 
and disconnect the power supply. Check resistance from the tab of Q6 
to ground and from pin 1 of the MCU (U1) to ground. Both should be 
over 500 ohms. If the tab of Q6 measures low resistance, look for D7 
installed backward or a solder bridge across the pins of Q6. If pin 1 of 
the MCU measures low, put on a wrist strap (or touch ground) and 
remove U1, then re-check the resistance. If it’s still low, you could 
have a short on the 5-volt or 2.7-volt lines.  
 Switch to voltmeter display mode (using BAND + RIT , twice) to 
make sure that the battery or power supply voltage is not being pulled 
down when the KX1 is turned on. If it is, it could indicate a short or 
incorrect component somewhere in the transmit stages. 
 Repeat the receiver alignment steps (page 45). This is necessary 
because some components added in Assembly Part III may affect the 
tuning of the receiver’s band-pass filters. 
i
   If receiver gain seems to be too low after re-alignment, you 
may have an assembly error in the transmit stages, low-pass filter, or 
T-R limiter (Q7). Turn the KX1 off, remove the top cover, and re-
check the orientation of all diodes, transistors, and ICs. Look for shorts 
on both the top and bottom of the board in the transmitter area. (Also 
see Troubleshooting.) 
 Turn the KX1 off.  
 Connect a 50-ohm dummy load to the antenna jack, along with a 
wattmeter if available. The dummy load should be rated at 5 watts or 
higher. 
 Connect a key or keyer paddle. 
 Set R4 fully clockwise. 
 Turn the KX1 on.

  TUNE mode (key-down) is activated by pressing the MENU 
and BAND switches together. Tapping any switch or the keyer paddle 
will cancel TUNE. During TUNE, the display will show  tun. (If the 
KXAT1 ATU option is installed, the display will instead show both 
power output in watts and SWR. Refer to the KXAT1 manual for 
details.) 
 
20-Meter Transmit Test 
 Switch to the 14-MHz band using  BAND. Set the VFO to 
approximately 14100 kHz. 
 If a monitor receiver (or transceiver) is available, connect a very 
short antenna wire (1 to 3 feet) to its RF input and set it to the KX1’s 
indicated VFO frequency. 
i
  Do not remain in TUNE mode for more than 5 to 10 
seconds at a time. If you cannot hear the KX1 in the monitor 
receiver, or if you suspect there’s a problem, cancel TUNE mode 
immediately and see Troubleshooting. 
 Put the KX1 into TUNE mode by holding MENU + BAND . You 
should see tun on the display. Listen for the KX1’s signal in the 
monitor receiver and/or check the wattmeter indication, then exit 
TUNE mode by tapping any switch.  
i
  The wattmeter should indicate approximately 3 to 4 watts 
with a 12-14 V supply. If power is significantly lower than this, the 
KX1 could be drawing more current than your power supply or battery 
can handle, or R4 may not be set fully clockwise. If neither of these 
seems to be the problem, see Troubleshooting.
 
40-Meter Transmit Test 
 Switch to 40 meters (7 MHz). Set the VFO to about 7100 kHz. 
 Put the KX1 into TUNE mode by holding MENU + BAND . You 
should see tun on the display. Listen for the KX1’s signal in the 
monitor receiver and/or check the wattmeter indication, then exit 
TUNE mode by tapping any switch. 
i
  If 40-meter power output is less than 3 to 4 watts with a 12-14 
V supply, see Troubleshooting.  
 If both bands have adequate output power but 20 meters is 
higher, you should adjust the windings of toroidal inductor L2. To do 
this, “squeeze” the turns of L2 together slightly so that they occupy 
only about 70% of the core’s circumference. With L2 at its optimal 
turns spacing (for best harmonic rejection), 20 meter output will be 
about 0.3 to 0.6 watts lower than 40 meters. 
Keying Test 
 Connect a keyer paddle or hand key to the KEY/PADDLE jack. 
 Key the KX1 while listening in the monitor receiver. The keying 
should sound clean and stable.  During keying, one bar will be shown 
on the LED bargraph. (If the KXAT1 ATU is installed, the bargraph 
will instead show approximate power output in 0.5-watt increments (0 
to 3 watts). 
 Turn the KX1 off and disconnect the power supply, key or 
paddle, and antenna.

Operation
This section covers all KX1 connectors, controls, and operating 
features. For a one-page Quick Reference, see Appendix G. 
Connections 
Internal Battery 
Connect the internal battery to P1 on the PC board. Make sure the 
battery wires aren’t pinched when you install the bottom cover. 
Battery Selection: For best performance, use 1.5-volt cells (9 volts—
see table). Energizer lithium type L91 or fresh Alkaline cells are 
recommended. Lithium cells are more expensive, but have high energy 
density, a flat discharge curve, and weigh less than Alkalines. 1.2-volt 
cells (e.g. NiMH) can also be used,  but will provide lower output and 
reduced operating time, and near end of charge will not meet the 
KX1’s minimum supply voltage spec (7 V). You must remove 
rechargeable batteries (e.g., NiMH) for charging.

Low-Battery Warning: If the supply voltage drops below the value 
set in the BAT menu entry, you’ll see BAT LO on the LED every 
five minutes. Set BAT to 7.5 V for Alkaline or Lithium cells, 6.5 V 
for NiMH, and 10.5 V for an external 12 V battery. 
External Power Supply 
You can connect any 7-14 V DC power supply or battery to J1, 
although you should use the minimum recommended voltage (8 V) 
when possible. The KX1 will run from whichever is higher in voltage, 
the internal battery or the external supply. Transmit current drain will 
be 300-700 mA, depending on the supply voltage. 
Headphones or External Speaker 
The AF output jack, J4, can accommodate either headphones or a 
small speaker (8-32 Ω). A stereo plug is required. Earbud-style 
headphones are recommended (Sony MDR series or equivalent, with 
sensitivity of 108 dB/mW). They are lightweight, sensitive, and mask 
wind noise well. 
Antenna 
Any resonant antenna can be connected to J7. With the KXAT1 ATU, 
you can connect random-length wires, often without any feedline (see 
KXAT1 manual). With a KXAT1 installed, power and SWR will be 
displayed in TUNE mode, and power output is shown on the bargraph 
during keying. If no KXAT1 is installed, the display will show one bar 
on transmit, and tun  in TUNE mode. 
Keying Device 
You can connect a hand key or external keyer to J3, or connect a 
paddle (such as the optional KXPD1) and use the KX1's built-in 
memory keyer. A stereo plug is required. You can also use the KX1's 
front-panel buttons to send CW (see page 68).

Controls and Display 
Power Switch 
Set POWER ON to turn on the KX1. If the LED display is too dim, 
hold MENU , BAND , or RIT at power-up. This selects maximum 
LED brightness and also turns on audible CW switch feedback at 10, 
20, or 30 WPM respectively (see page 69).  
Lamp Switch 
Set LAMP ON to turn on the lamp at the front-left edge of the KX1. 
The lamp can be used to illuminate a log book placed in front of the 
KX1, or as a flashlight. In an emergency it can be used for visible 
signaling. The white LED used is extremely efficient. Its current 
requirement varies with supply voltage, from about 5 mA at 7 V to 15 
mA at 14 V. You can substitute a red LED if desired. 
LED Display 
The 3-digit LED display shows the operating frequency, S-meter or 
power output bargraph, menu entries, etc. Brightness and ‘on-time’ are 
programmable (see LED, page 65). You can also use audible CW 
switch feedback in addition to the display (page 67).  
Brightness: The display is most useful in low to moderate lighting 
situations, where it requires only about 1-3 mA total current. Brighter 
settings are also available that require up to 10 mA. If the display is 
too dim when the KX1 is first turned on, you can quickly select 
maximum brightness, and simultaneously enable CW feedback on 
switch press, by holding one of the three pushbutton switches when 
the KX1 is turned on (see Power Switch, above).  
Decimal Points: The decimal point shifts to indicate the VFO tuning 
rate, and is flashed when RIT is enabled. 
Bargraph: In S-meter mode, the bargraph indicates received signal 
strength  (see SIG, page 65). On transmit, it shows 1 bar per 0.5 W 
output if the ATU is installed, and 1 bar otherwise. 
VFO Knob/Tuning Rate Switch 
This control adjusts the VFO frequency, RIT offset (RIT , next page), 
keyer speed (WPM , next page), and is also used in the menu (page 
66). Tapping the knob selects 100-Hz or 10-Hz VFO steps. Holding it 
for 0.5 seconds selects 1 kHz or 5 kHz VFO steps, depending on the 
receive mode (page 66). It is also used in along with other switches to 
activate certain advanced features. 
Transmit frequency ranges: The KX1 transmits only in the ham 
bands (7.0-7.3, 10.10-10.15, and 14.0-14.35 MHz). Transmit will be 
prevented once you move a few kHz outside of each band, and you'll 
see END  flashed on the display.  
Potentiometers 
RF GAIN: Sets the receive RF gain. Normally set fully clockwise, but 
can be rotated counter-clockwise to attenuate strong signals. 
FILTER:  Adjusts the receive crystal filter bandwidth over a range of 
about 300 to 2000 Hz. Narrow-bandwidth settings can be used to 
reduce interference from nearby signals when copying CW. Wider 
bandwidth settings are useful for copying SSB and AM. 
AF GAIN: Sets the receive audio output level. The sidetone volume 
can be set higher or lower in relation to receiver audio using the STL 
menu entry (page 65). 
POWER LEVEL (R4 - internal): This trimmer potentiometer is 
accessible through a hole in the bottom cover, and can be set using a 
small tuning tool or flat-blade screwdriver.  
i
  For best performance, keep R4 set fully clockwise, unless 
you must reduce power to conserve battery life. This control 
should not be adjusted frequently; trimmer potentiometers have a 
finite life (100-200 rotations).

Pushbutton Switch Functions 
There are three small pushbutton switches below the display. A fourth 
pushbutton switch is built into the VFO knob.  
TAP  a switch to access its upper function (white label); HOLD a 
switch for 1/2 second to access its lower function (yellow label). Some 
switches can be held in combination as described at right. 
Note: The MENU , BAND , and RIT switches can also be used at 
power-on to select maximum LED display brightness and turn on CW 
feedback on switch press at 10, 20, or 30 WPM (see page 67). 
Switch TAP and HOLD Functions 
MENU  
Displays the menu (see next page) 
EDIT   
Edits current menu parameter 
 
BAND 
One tap shows frequency (MHz first, then kHz;        L 
or U is added in LSB or USB modes). Two quick taps 
selects the next higher band. 
WPM  
Allows keyer speed adjustment using VFO control (8-
50 WPM) without transmitting. 
 
RIT 
Turns RIT on/off. When RIT is on, the decimal point 
will flash slowly. The VFO knob will then vary only 
the receive frequency, in 20 Hz steps, +/- 5 kHz. 
CLR 
Zeros RIT offset When RIT is OFF, holding CLR for 
two seconds starts scanning (page 66).

TUNE:  Initiates TUNE mode (key-down) 
Note: Limit TUNE time to 10 seconds on, 10 seconds off.              If a 
KXAT1 ATU is installed, you’ll see ATU for a few seconds during 
TUNE, followed by the power output (e.g. P2.0). Tapping any switch 
will cancel TUNE and flash the SWR (e.g. r1.0). If no ATU is 
installed, the display will show tun, since the KX1 itself does not 
include power metering. You'll still need to tap a switch or the keyer 
paddle to exit TUNE mode even in the non-ATU case. 
 
BAND + RIT   
DISP:  Selects display mode 
Selects frequency (nor), S-meter (bargraph), or battery voltage 
(BAT) display mode. In S-meter mode, the frequency is re-displayed 
whenever the VFO is moved. S-meter mode functions as Frequency 
Announce mode if audible CW feedback is enabled (page 67). Battery 
display mode can be used during transmit or receive; in transmit mode, 
it overrides the bargraph or TUNE display. 
The remaining switch combinations are described in the Advanced

Advanced Operating Features 
Recording and Playing CW Messages 
The KX1 provides two message memories of  48 bytes each. CW 
messages can only be recorded using the KX1’s internal keyer.  
Set INP to PDn or PDr to use the internal keyer. 
To Record: Tap MENU and locate the PLY menu entry, change it to 
REC by holding EDIT, then tap either 1 or 2. The display will show 
048, indicating that 48 bytes of storage are available in this buffer. 
This number will count down toward 0 as long as you are sending. 
Whenever you stop sending completely, up to two standard-length 
word spaces will be inserted. To stop recording, tap any switch. If you 
do this before starting to send, the original message contents will be 
preserved. 
To Play: Tap MENU and locate the PLY menu entry, then tap either 
1 or 2. Message play can be canceled at any time by hitting any key or 
by tapping the keyer paddle. You can also change the keyer speed 
while messages are playing using the VFO knob. 
To use Auto-Repeat: Locate the PLY menu entry as before, but then 
hold either 1 or 2. The message will then play back continuously until 
you tap another switch or hit your key or paddle. You'll see RPT on 
the display between message transmissions. 
Setting the Auto-Repeat Interval: The length of the pause between 
messages during auto-repeat can be programmed using the RPT menu 
entry (0-255 sec.). Long delays are useful for beacons. 
Keyer Test Mode: To play back messages without transmitting, use 
keyer test mode. In this mode, you'll see P=0 on the LED during 
message play, rather than the transmit bargraph. To turn keyer test 
mode on/off, locate the PLY menu entry, then tap the VFO knob. 
You'll see P=0 and nor on alternate taps. 
Receive Mode Selection (CW, LSB, USB) 
The KX1 provides three receive modes: CW (nor or "normal"), 
LSB, and USB.  Hold MENU + RIT to select the desired mode. 
In CW (nor) receive mode, LSB is used on 40 meters, and USB is 
used on 30 and 20 meters. In this mode a CW offset is introduced on 
receive, which means that you must match received-signal pitch to 
your sidetone pitch to determine a station's carrier frequency. CW 
mode also provides a 1 kHz fast VFO tuning rate, compatible with 
ham-band tuning. 
LSB and USB receive modes have no receive CW offset, so the 
VFO will show a station's carrier frequency when a voice signal is 
tuned in properly (SSB) or when a carrier is zero-beated (AM or CW). 
The required CW offset is instead introduced on transmit. These 
modes also provide a 5 kHz fast VFO tuning rate, useful for tuning 
SWL band segments. 
Cross-mode (CW/SSB) operation: Cross-mode contacts can be made 
in all three of the KX1's receive modes, without the need to use RIT. 
When an SSB signal is correctly tuned in, and you transmit, the SSB 
station will hear you at about a 600-Hz pitch. 
Receiver performance considerations: Several strong internally-
generated signals can be heard outside of the ham bands7. If one of 
these signals falls near an AM signal of interest, try switching 
sidebands to reduce interference. Note: on 20 meters, USB and nor 
(CW) receive modes provide somewhat better sensitivity than LSB 
mode. See Circuit Details for an explanation. 
                                                     
7 These signals originate either at the DDS or from mixing products, and are 
typical for a superhet receiver  using a low I.F. Strong signals appear at the 
following frequencies, in kHz, with the applicable sideband shown in 
parentheses: 5895 (USB), 6141 (USB), 6358 (LSB), 6550 (USB), 7989 
(LSB), 9148 (both), 9826 (both), 14740 (both), 14981 (both). Additional 
weak signals can also be heard, but in general will be masked by band noise.

Scanning: 
 To set up scanning, use the STO menu function to save scan start/end 
points in frequency memories 1 and 2 (for each band). Now, whenever 
RIT is off, you can activate scanning by holding CLR for two 
seconds. Scanning is “live” (not muted). It can be stopped by tapping a 
switch, turning the VFO, or transmitting. If the VFO is set for 10 or 
100 Hz steps, scanning proceeds at 100 Hz per step. If the VFO is set 
for fast tuning, scanning uses 1 kHz steps (if the receive mode is LSB 
or USB, 5 kHz steps are used outside ham bands). 
 
Using Frequency Memories 
Three frequency memories are available on each band, accessed using 
the RCL (recall) menu entry. In addition to VFO frequency, the 
receive mode (CW/LSB/USB) is saved on a per-memory basis. 
Any one memory can be designated as High-Priority when it is 
stored, as described below. This allows you to quickly switch to one 
often-used memory—such as WWV or a net—and back. 
To store: First tap MENU and scroll to the RCL menu entry (memory 
recall). Hold EDIT to change the menu entry to STO (store), then tap 
1, 2, or 10/100 (VFO knob).  The display will flash 1, 2, or 3 in 
response. However, if you hold rather than tap the switch that selects 
the memory, that memory will become the high-priority memory, and 
the display will instead flash 1H, 2H, or 3H. Exit the menu. 
To recall: Tap MENU, locate RCL, then tap 1, 2, or 10/100 . The 
recalled frequency and mode will be displayed. Exit the menu. 
Switching to the High-Priority memory: First, press and hold BAND 
+ 10/100, which will switch to the high-priority memory, if one has 
been assigned. The stored receive mode will be used, and if the band 
changed, the ATU L/C values will also be recalled. If desired, you can 
then restore your original band and frequency by holding BAND + 
10/100 again. Exception: If you tap BAND or change receive modes 
in the interim, the restore operation will be cancelled, and the KX1 
will remain on the new band. 
Audible CW Feedback on Switch Press 
When CW feedback is turned on, audio Morse code will be sent in 
response to all KX1 controls, when using the menu, etc. This is useful 
when the display cannot be used, such as in very bright sunlight or 
when eyes-free operation is required. Speeds from 10 to 40 WPM can 
be selected, in 5-WPM steps. 
To turn on CW feedback on switch press: Either (1) set the CFB 
menu parameter to the desired CW feedback speed; or (2) hold the  
MENU , BAND , or RIT switch down at power-on, which forces CFB 
to 10, 20, or 30 WPM respectively. This also sets the LED to 
maximum brightness and reports the firmware revision (on the display 
and in CW). 
Differences between LED display and CW feedback: 
1. All zeros are converted to long T's, and decimal points are sent as 
R (a CW standard, derived from the word "radix"). In the DDS 
and BFO menu entries, the minus sign (-) is sent as N. For 
example, a BFO parameter of -.16 would be sent as NR16. 
2. Some 3-letter text strings are reduced to a single letter. These 
include RIT on (R), RIT off (O), RIT clear (C), VFO lock (L), 
VFO unlock (U), nor/LSB/USB receive modes (N, L, U), and 
nor/announce/batt display modes (N, A, B). "Frequency 
Announce" display mode (A) is discussed below. 
3. When using the menu, you can scroll quickly past menu entries if 
desired, which will truncate sending of associated text in CW. The 
PLY (Play) menu entry is truncated to P. 
4. The VFO frequency can be checked at any time by tapping BAND 
once. The frequency will be announced in MHz and kHz, prefixed 
by U or L in USB or LSB mode, and followed by R if RIT is 
turned on. The kHz part of the frequency, and R for RIT if 
applicable, is also sent when you select the fast tuning rate. 
5. Frequency Announce display mode provides audible "tics" every 
10 VFO steps, and reports the kHz digits every 100 VFO steps 
(i.e., every 10 kHz if 100-Hz tuning is selected). This is useful for 
finding a specific frequency. The "tic" sound is a low tone, high 

============================================================

    ELECRAFT 
tone, or low/high tone (for 10 Hz, 100 Hz, and 1 or 5 kHz VFO 
steps, respectively). Frequency Announce mode is turned on in the 
same was as S-meter mode (hold the DISP switch combination, 
BAND + RIT). When you select announce mode, AF (for 
announce frequency) will be displayed, and the letter A will be 
sent in CW. Holding the DISP switch combination again will 
switch to battery display mode (B) and back to normal mode (N). 
Switch CW: Sending CW using Front-Panel Switches 
In an emergency, the BAND  switch can be used as a hand key, or the 
BAND and RIT switches can be used as a keyer paddle. To enable this 
feature, first use the INP menu entry to specify hand key (HND) or 
one of the paddle modes (PDn / PDr). Next, press and hold the 
MENU switch and 10/100  simultaneously to toggle Switch CW on 
and off. You’ll see btn (“button”) when switch CW is on, and Pdl 
(“paddle”) when it is off.   
When switch CW is enabled and INP is set to HND (hand key), the 
normal functions of the BAND / WPM  switch are not available. In 
addition, if  INP is set to PDn or PDr, the functions of the RIT / 
CLR  switch are not available. To use the normal functions of these 
switches, turn off Switch CW mode as described above. 
VFO Lock/Unlock 
Holding RIT + 10/100 locks (LOC) or unlocks (nor) the VFO knob. 
When the VFO is locked, rotating the knob will have no effect on the 
VFO frequency or RIT offset, and tapping or holding the knob will not 
change the tuning rate. The knob can still be used for  changing the 
CW keying speed or accessing the menu. 
Operating Frequency Calibration 
The KX1's VFO display accuracy should be about +/- 200 Hz without 
calibration. Using the BFO and DDS calibration procedures below, 
you can improve accuracy to typically +/- 10 Hz.  
Before calibration, the KX1 should be turned on and allowed to 
stabilize at room temperature for 15 minutes. 
BFO Calibration: This procedure compensates for the difference 
between your BFO frequency and the nominal value (4913.00 kHz).  
1.  Select 40 or 30 meters, LSB receive mode. 
2.  In the menu, set BFO to .00, and DDS to 00. Exit the menu. 
Tune in a strong station at a known frequency as accurately as 
possible. You can zero-beat an unmodulated carrier (tune for 0 Hz 
audio pitch), or tune in an AM broadcast or reference station such as 
WWV. Write down the frequency shown on the dial. 
4.  Switch to USB, re-tune the signal, and write down this frequency. 
5.  Subtract the lower reading from the higher reading, then divide the 
result by two. Example: USB = 10000.10 kHz, LSB = 9999.90 
kHz. Subtracting LSB from USB leaves 0.20 kHz, and dividing by 
2 yields 0.10 kHz. This is the BFO correction. 
6.  If the LSB reading was the lower of the two, set the BFO menu 
parameter to the BFO correction value (in this example, .10). If the 
USB reading was the lower one, set the BFO parameter to the 
negative of the correction (in this example, -.10). 
7.  Exit the menu. You should now be able to switch between LSB and 
USB receive modes without re-tuning the VFO. 
DDS Calibration: This procedure compensates for any error in the 
50-MHz reference oscillator. The BFO calibration procedure, above, 
must be performed first. 
1.  Select 40 or 30 meters and LSB or USB  receive mode. Don't 
use CW (nor) mode, as this introduces a receive offset. 
2.  Tune the VFO to the exact specified frequency of a reference 
signal. Example: For WWV at 10 MHz, you must tune to exactly 
10000.00 kHz as indicated on the KX1's display. You might start 
with 5 kHz steps (hold the VFO knob), but then switch to 100 Hz 
and finally 10 Hz steps as you get closer (by tapping the knob).  
3.  Edit the DDS menu parameter. While listening to the reference 
signal, use the VFO knob to adjust the parameter so that the signal 
is properly tuned in. If it is an unmodulated carrier, tune for zero-

beat (0 Hz audio). If it's a voice signal, tune for most natural-
sounding audio. Then exit the menu. 
Checking the Firmware Revision 
Hold any switch on power-up to display the revision (e.g. 1.01). 
Note: Checking the firmware revision by holding MENU , BAND , or 
RIT on power-up also sets the LED to high brightness and enables 
CW feedback on switch press (at 10, 20, and 30 WPM respectively). If 
you turn the KX1 back off before accessing the menu, the LED 
brightness and CW feedback will revert to their previous settings. 
Resetting to Factory Defaults 
Reset to defaults takes two steps. Step 1: Hold BAND and MENU 
together on power-up, releasing the switches after the LED test. You 
should see E09.  Step 2: Turn power off and back on again; you 
should see E10. Tap any switch. You'll then need to set up all menu 
entries again.

QRP Operating Tips 
Antennas: When you're using low power, a good antenna and ground 
system can make a big difference. There are many references on 
antennas available, including the ARRL Antenna Handbook.  
QRP Frequencies: Low-power enthusiasts can be found at certain 
"watering hole" frequencies on each band, listed below (kHz). An 
asterisk (*) indicates European or alternative QRP frequencies. 
80 m:    3560 
40 m:    7040 (*7030) 
30 m:  10106 (*10116)  
20 m:  14060 
 
 
 
Calling and Listening: Calling CQ with low power may be 
frustrating unless you have a very good antenna. Expect to spend far 
more time listening. Keep transmissions short, especially when 
working other QRP stations, which will often be at or even below the 
noise level. Narrower filters (less than 500 Hz) and slower code speeds 
(less than 20 WPM) should be used when conditions are marginal. 
 
SWL (Shortwave Listening) Tips 
Tuning Range: The KX1 can tune a wide range on each band: 
80 m:   1-5.5 MHz  
 
40 m:   5-9.5 MHz 
 
30 m:   8-12.5 MHz 
 
20 m:  12-16.5 MHz 
The 80 meter and 30 meter frequencies are available when the optional 
KXB3080 (30 m and 80m) or the KXB30 (30 m only) modules are 
installed.  
The useful tuning range is actually somewhat smaller, since signals 
will fall off as you tune outside the ham bands (note the exception to 
this described in the next paragraph).  
Using the KXB30 or KXB3080 on 30 and 40 meters: If you have the 
KXB30 or KXB3080 option installed, you'll be able to use the 
associated ham bands and receive nearby SWL segments. But this 
option has another important function: its tuning capacitors will be 
turned on automatically on 40 meters if you tune below 6.7 MHz. This 
re-resonates the band-pass filter at about 6.2 MHz, greatly improving 
sensitivity in the popular 49-meter SWL segment (5.9-6.4 MHz). 
Tuning AM or SSB signals: The FILTER control should be set fully 
clockwise when listening to broadcast stations. While you can listen to 
AM or SSB stations in any of the KX1's three receive modes 
(CW/LSB/USB), LSB or USB provide two advantages: elimination of 
the CW receive offset, and 5 kHz rather than 1 kHz tuning steps. You 
can use 10-Hz steps to fine-tune (zero-beat) AM signals. 
Frequency Memories and High-Priority Memory: Commonly-used 
SWL frequencies can be store in frequency memories. If you often 
switch to a time reference such as WWV (at 5, 10, or 15 MHz), you 
can designate the associated memory as high-priority for quick access 
(see page 67).

KX1 Options 
30-Meter Module (KXB30) 
The KXB30 adds 30 meter coverage to the KX1, and also greatly 
increases receive sensitivity in the 5.9-6.4 MHz SWL segment (with 
40 m selected). 30 meters is an excellent band for day and night 
operation and is popular with QRPers. Being a WARC band, it is off-
limits for contests, and is thus a haven for those not interested in 
contest operation. WWV or WWVH provide universal coordinated 
time announcements at 10.000 MHz, and many AM broadcast stations 
can be heard in the 9-10 MHz band. 
The B30 menu entry must be set to ON to use the 30-m band. 
30 and 80-Meter Module (KXB3080) 
The KXB3080 adds both 30 meter and 80 meter coverage to the KX1. 
Like the KXB30, the KXB3080 also greatly increases receive 
sensitivity in the 5.9-6.4 MHz SWL segment (with 40 m selected). 
When 80 m is selected, the tuning range is increased from 1.0 to 5.5 
MHz. 
The B80 menu entry must be set to ON to enable both the 30 m and 
80m bands when the KXB3080 module is installed.   
Plug-In Keyer Paddle (KXPD1) 
The KXPD1 paddle offers a rugged, lightweight alternative to 
traditional keyer paddles or hand keys. It plugs directly into the front 
of the KX1, and is ergonomically designed for operating comfort. The 
KXPD1 is retained by a thumb screw to prevent movement during 
keying, and can quickly be reversed for left- or right-handed operation. 
 
 
 
Automatic Antenna Tuner (KXAT1) 
With the KXAT1 internal automatic antenna tuner installed, you can 
connect unbalanced, random-length antennas directly to the KX1. (An 
inexpensive home-made balun can be used with balanced lines.) In 
many cases the ATU will provide a 2:1 or better match on all bands. 
Once you've tuned up an antenna, the tuner's L and C settings will be 
recalled instantly when the band is changed.  
The KXAT1 provides SWR and power information for the KX1 
display in TUNE mode. Also, during normal keying it provides an 
indication of power output on the LED bargraph (1 bar per 0.5 watts). 
Without the ATU installed, the KX1 displays tun in TUNE mode and 
1 bar during keying.

Circuit Details 
 
While reading this section, refer to the Block Diagram (Appendix C) 
and schematics (Appendix B). 
Receiver: The receiver is a single-conversion superhet, using down-
conversion to a low intermediate frequency (I.F.) of about 4.915 MHz. 
Down-conversion minimizes complexity and receive-chain noise, 
while the low I.F. allows adequate CW selectivity with a variable-
passband, 3-pole crystal filter. The use of active mixers keeps current 
consumption low, compatible with portable operation. 
DDS VFO: The VFO is based on a low-power DDS (direct digital 
synthesis) IC. A crystal oscillator provides the reference signal for the 
DDS, ensuring excellent frequency stability over a wide temperature 
range. While a DDS-based VFO does not offer the same signal purity 
as an L-C VFO or PLL synthesizer, it is a good choice for a portable 
station that will most often be used by a single operator well removed 
from strong nearby stations. It is also extremely frequency-agile, 
allowing coverage of both ham bands and SWL bands. The unit 
chosen (AD9834) requires a minimum of components and draws only 
5 to 8 milliamps. 
 
The DDS output is filtered by low-pass filter L4/L5/C50-52. In order 
to provide adequate roll-off of non-harmonic spurs about 14 MHz 
when operating at 40 meters, the filter's knee is set just above the 20-m 
band edge. Because of this, LSB receive mode on 20 meters is less 
sensitive; LSB on this band requires a mixer injection frequency of 
4.9+14 = 18.9 MHz, which is significantly attenuated by the DDS 
filter. 
Transmitter: On transmit, the DDS outputs the actual carrier 
frequency, so no transmit mixer stage is required. Q1, Q4 and Q5 form 
a 3-stage buffer for the DDS signal. Maximum power output from the 
final stage (Q6) is about 4 to 5 watts, depending on the supply voltage. 
Q7, in the receive band-pass filter, limits the signal voltage that can 
reach the receive mixer when the rig is in transmit mode.  
Microcontroller: A low-power microcontroller (U1, MCU) is used to 
control the transceiver and handle user interface elements, such as the 
display and switches. The MCU communicates with the optional 
KXAT1 ATU on the VFWD/DATA line at about a 2 kHz data rate. 
U1 runs at just below 4 MHz to avoid band-edge spurs. 
The KXAT1 provides SWR and power information for the KX1 
display in TUNE mode. During normal keying, it provides an accurate 
indication of power output (1 bar per 0.5 watts). Without the ATU 
installed, the KX1 displays only a qualitative power output indication 
(see page 64).

Appendix E - Troubleshooting
KX1 TOP COVER REMOVAL: (1) Remove the three flat-head screws 
that hold the PCB to the top cover. (2) remove the VFO knob. (3) Flex the front 
edge of the top cover outward slightly while pulling upward gently on the key 
jack. The key jack should pop out of its hole. (3) Lift out the PCB.  
 
(!) NOTE: If you need to transmit with the top cover removed, Q6 will not have 
a heatsink. Turn the power control (R4) fully counter-clockwise to limit power 
to 0.5 watt or less. To prevent damage to the PA transistor, limit transmit time 
to 3 seconds keydown, 10 seconds key up. 
 
KX1 TOP COVER INSTALLATION: (1) Place the top cover onto the 
PC board. Align switch caps with their holes using a long tool inserted between 
PCB and top cover. (2) Snap the key jack into its hole by pushing down gently. 
(3) Secure the PCB to the top cover using three 4-40 x 1/4" flat-head screws. 
(4) Install the VFO knob. 
 
General Troubleshooting Procedure 
 
 
Look for your problem in the Troubleshooting Tables. 
 
Closely examine PC boards for poor solder joints and incorrect, broken or 
missing components. 
 
Check voltages using the DC Voltage Table at the end of this section. 
 
Error Messages 
 
If you see a message such as  E10 on the LED, look up the  corresponding 
entry in the Troubleshooting Tables. Error messages can usually be cleared by 
pressing any switch. However, the cause of the message should be investigated 
before continuing to operate the transceiver. 
Troubleshooting Tables 
 
There are five troubleshooting tables (listed below). Within each table, 
problems are identified by 2-digit numbers for cross-referencing purposes. In 
most cases you’ll know which table to look in based on the symptoms you 
observe. If in doubt, start with the General Troubleshooting table. Some 
problem identifiers have corresponding error messages (see above).

VFO (40-59) 
 
Problem 
Troubleshooting Steps 
40  General VFO 
(DDS) problem;  
frequency jumps or 
drifts 
 
Note: A small amount of DDS drift may 
occur due to aging of components and 
heating/cooling of the cabinet   
 
Check 14 MHz LPF components (L4, L5, 
C50-C52) and buffer (Q1, R31) 
 
Make sure supply voltage is above 6.5V 
 
Check values of R8, R6, R7, RP4, RP3 
 
Check 5V and 2.7V regulator output (23) 
 
Check installation of Z2 and U2 (both surface 
mount--use magnifying glass) 
41 Can't tune VFO (or 
RIT offset) 
 
VFO may be locked  ( see Operation) 
 
VFO or RIT offset may be at end of range 
 
See 40, above 
42  No DDS output 
 
See 40 
 
Receiver (60-79) 
 
Problem 
Troubleshooting Steps 
60  Low (or no) audio 
output from receiver, 
or general receiver 
gain problem 
 
If you hear normal audio output on one band 
but not all bands, see 62 
 
Make sure you have headphones or speaker 
connected; turn AF GAIN clockwise 
 
Check the key jack for a short to ground 
 
Make sure RF GAIN is fully clockwise 
 
Re-peak the band-pass filters  
 
Check for ground shorts in the LPF and BPF  
 
If you don’t hear any “hiss” at the receiver 
output, troubleshoot the AF amplifier (65) 
 
Check the 6V regulator (20) 
62  Signal loss only on 
one band 
 
Re-do alignment on affected band 
 
Check the band-pass and low-pass filters and 
crystal for this band 
 
Check functioning of the relays (change 
bands, then measure relay leads that should 
be open or shorted for that band) 
65  AF amplifier not 
working 
 
Use the STL menu entry to set a sidetone 
level of 3. If you hear a strong tone, the A.F. 
amplifier (RF-U4) is probably working, and 
the problem is likely to be with the mixer 
(RF-U6) or other RF board circuits. 
 
Signal trace through the receive chain 
backwards by touching a tool or wire to 
various points along the receive path  
 
Check all DC voltages in the receiver 
 
Inspect the A.F. amp circuits 
70  AGC or S-meter 
not working 
 
Check R5, D4, C53, Q9, R20, C8, and L9 for 
incorrect values or unsoldered leads 
 
Transmitter and Keyer (80-99) 
 
Problem 
Troubleshooting Steps 
80  General 
Transmitter problem 
 
If power output is too low, go to 86 
 
If power output slowly increases during key-
down, go to 88 
 
If current drain on transmit is too high for the 
given power level, go to 92 
 
If the transmitter output power seems to be 
unstable go to 88 
 
If the transmitter stops transmitting by itself 
go to 90 
 
If the keyer isn’t working properly, go to 95 
86  Power output is 
low or zero 
 
Make sure the power-output control, R4, is 
set fully clockwise 
 
If the top cover is removed, make sure you 
don't have a screw inserted into the tab of Q6 
 
Unplug the ATU (KXAT1) and insert a 
jumper between pins 1 and 3 of J7; connect a 
dummy load at J2. If this solves the problem, 
see the KXAT1 manual's troubleshooting 
section. 
 
Check power output when using a 50Ω 
dummy load; if the output is correct on a 
dummy load but not when using an antenna, 
your antenna is probably not matched 
 
You may have a short in the LPF or BPF or

an incorrect LPF component value 
 
Check relays (25) 
 
Examine T1, L3, L1, and L2 for poorly-
stripped leads  
 
Check T1 for backward windings 
 
Check all DC voltages in the transmitter (Q1, 
Q4, Q5, Q6)  
 
Signal-trace through the transmitter to find 
where signal is lost (using an RF probe) 
 
Check for any components getting hot  
 
 
88  Power output 
fluctuates 
 
If you stay in key-down (TUNE) mode for 
several seconds, it is normal to see some 
increase in power; this is due heating of the 
final amplifier transistor. 
 
If power goes up and down significantly 
during normal keying, you may have a 
poorly-matched antenna OR you may have 
power set too high for your battery or power 
supply to handle; try reducing power or 
replacing batteries 
 
If the transmitter is unstable (oscillating) 
even when connected to a 50-Ω load, you 
may have an incorrect component value or a 
toroid-winding error (86) 
90  Output power 
drops to zero suddenly  
 
If you have transmit power set too high for 
your battery or power supply, the supply 
voltage may drop so low on transmit that it 
resets the MCU (U1); try a higher supply 
voltage or fresh batteries 
 
If there's no ATU installed, verify that J7 
(ATU connector) is bypassed with a jumper 
between pins 1 and 3 
92  Current drain too 
high on transmit 
 
You may have power set higher than the final 
amplifier can achieve for a given load or 
power supply voltage, resulting in overdrive 
of transmitter stages. Reduce power to see if 
normal current drain is restored. 
 
Damaged PA transistors or other components 
could cause inefficiency in any stage of the 
transmitter. Check all DC voltages and 
components; signal trace if necessarily (86)  
95  Keyer Problem 
 
 
If the keyer is generally erratic when 
transmitting and seems to get worse as power 
is increased, you probably have RF leaking 
into the keyline. Try bypassing your key with 
.001 µF capacitors; also try 100 µH RF 
chokes in series with the paddle connections. 
 
Seek a better antenna match 
 
Improve your ground system

DC Voltage Table – Integrated Circuits 
NOTES: Measurements were made with a 50-ohm dummy load connected and a supply voltage of 13 V. The 30- meter option 
was installed (KXB30) and the ATU was removed (KXAT1). In general, your measurements should be within 10% of the values 
shown. Pins NOT listed in the table should indicate 0.0 volts DC.  Pins marked with (*) are hard to measure due to noise 
pickup. Shaded areas show transmit-mode measurements (using TUNE).
