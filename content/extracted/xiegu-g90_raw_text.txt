Please read this manual carefully for a better experience and a full 
understanding of the operation of the G90/S. 
■ 
The G90S is the version sold in the People's Republic of China, the G90 is 
the version available in other countries. This operation manual is applicable 
to both models.   
Note: As this is a “Software Defined Radio” many things can be changed with a 
firmware upgrade. New features can be added and the operational processes 
can be changed. Therefore, it is recommended that you ensure your G-90/S is 
at the latest firmware level (as of this update of the manual, that was Firmware 
v1.79b03 released on October 26th 2022). If the instructions in this manual don’t 
appear to work as expected on your G-90/S it is highly likely that you are on a 
different firmware version.

♦ The specifications above may be changed without notice. 
♦ (*1) The operator is ALWAYS responsible to ensure he/she does not transmit 
using the radio outside of the amateur allocation (and in the case of an amateur 
without a full authority licence (i.e. entry level or novice) outside of the allocated 
frequencies in their licence). Radios that are sold to service the international 
market may at times have the ability to transmit on frequencies that are not 
available in some countries or under some licence classes. You as the operator 
MUST ensure that you do not transmit outside of your authorized frequency 
range (do not forget about the sideband(s) when operating close to the edge of 
a band). 
♦ (*2) FM mode was only fully available from version 1.75 of the firmware prior 
to that firmware version it was only available in conjunction with XIEGU’s GSOC 
controller. The two data modes U-D and L-D were added in FW v 1.79b02 
♦ (*3) The G90/S covers the range needed for the US 60m channels and the 
WRTC15 ITU band. It does not cover the bottom half of the UK 60m “bandlets”

Power Source Connection 
Connect your power supply or battery to the DC-IN connector. Current capability 
of the DC power supply should be at least 8 amps. Batteries should supply 10.5-
16.5V DC and have capacity to supply up to 10 amps. Typical current 
requirements on transmit are generally less than 8A. Use the provided cable to 
connect the G90/S to your DC supply. The G90/S transmitter is designed in 
such a way that dropping supply voltage from a weak battery has little effect on 
the transmitter output power until 10.5v is reached. 
The DC power supply must be connected in strict accordance with the following 
figure to avoid a reverse polarity connection. 
♦ The red wire must be connected with the positive pole of power supply and 
black wire to the negative pole of the power supply. 
 
 
♦ A Ferrite Choke may be attached to the power wires to prevent external RF 
from entering the radio via its power lines and RF interference from inside the 
radio from radiating externally via the power cable. When installing a ferrite 
choke, place it closest to the radio end of the DC cable. 
 
♦ Polarity of power cables should be checked carefully to avoid reverse 
polarity when connecting your power supply or battery. 
 
♦ Although the G90/S has reverse polarity protection reverse connection 
of power should be avoided.

Selection of Working Frequency Range 
The G90/S receives 0.5~30MHz but is set to only transmit on the amateur radio 
bands. The amateur bands are divided into 10 frequency blocks. 
 
Pressing the [<] or [>] BAND buttons will cycle through these bands. 
 
■ As well as the amateur bands shown, SW broadcast bands can be added in 
the sequence through system menu option 8 “Band Stacking”. This allows 
quicker selection of the broadcast bands to listen to them. Transmission mode 
is only available on the Amateur bands.  
■ The 60m frequency range set is 5.330.5-5.405MHz and includes the ITU 
WRC15 band of 5351.5 kHz to 5366.5 kHz plus the US channel frequencies. 
Should you require other channels or bandlets for example for operation in the 
UK, please contact your dealer so that he can program these in the unit for you. 
■ Frequency ranges for the bands can be dealer pre-set prior to sale in 
accordance to the regulations of the country (or region) of sale. 
■ VFO-A and VFO-B are two independent VFOs that can be set to different 
operating bands. See [VFO Settings] for details.

Setting Operational Frequency. 
 
There are three methods to set the frequency of G90/S. You may use the large 
main knob, the multi-function knob or the keypad buttons on the hand 
microphone. 
1. Set frequency by using main knob 
Momentarily press the main knob to select 100Hz, 1kHz, 10kHz or 100KHz 
steps. The selected range step position in the display will be graphic reversed. 
Rotate the main knob to set the frequency required using the currently selected 
step. 
2. Set frequency by using the multi-function hand microphone 
Press the white [F-INP ENT] button on the hand microphone. The G90/S will 
now be in frequency setting mode. The cursor will be blinking in the first column 
on the left of frequency display. 
Main knob 

============================================================
PAGE 25
============================================================

 
25 
Input the desired frequency values number by number and then press [F-INP 
ENT] again to complete setting the frequency. 
For example, press the keys in the following sequence to set current 
frequency to 14.09000MHz: 
1. 
Press [F-INP ENT] key first; 
2. 
Press the 
number keys 1 by 1;
3. 
Press [F-INP ENT] button again to complete the action. 
3. Quick adjustment of the frequency with the multi-function knob 
The Multi-function Adjustment Knob of the G90/S provides a method to quickly 
tune across the band. The function knob’s default function and increment is 
100khz. Hop from the CW to the SSB areas of the band in seconds. 
Note: This only works if the multi-function knob is set to change frequency. If its 
function has been changed (e.g. to SQL level) you will not be able to tune using 
the multi-function knob. 
Adjustment of RF Gain and Muting Level  
Proper RF gain adjustment can improve the quality of a received signal. In 
general, reducing the RF gain level on the low bands (40/60/80/160m) which 
have strong interference can significantly improve receive quality. In general, 
with SDR rigs, operating at full RF gain is detrimental to receive signal quality. 
Experiment with levels to find what is best for you. 
How to adjust the RF gain: 
1. Apply a long press on the [AGC] button at the bottom of the screen to enable 
the setting of RFGAIN. 
2. Rotate the main tuning knob to adjust the RF gain value. 
3. After setting your RF gain level, press the main knob inwards momentarily to 
exit the RF gain setting mode 
SQL setting 
You set the squelch level when you want to mute static in between 
transmissions normally used on AM or FM modes but will work on all phone 
modes. 
 
 

============================================================

Squelch Operation (prior to firmware v 1.75): 
1. Apply a long press on the [Multi-function Adjustment Knob] to enter the user 
defined function menu. Rotate the main knob to select the SQL Level option. 
2. Rotate the [Multi-function Adjustment Knob] to set the squelch muting level. 
At the same time, the muting level will show on the S meter. 
3. Momentarily press the button below the SAVE label at the bottom of the 
screen to select and exit. 
■ The muting strength gradually increases from S1 ~S9, corresponding to signal 
strength. For example, when the muting level is set to be S3. it indicates that 
the speaker will only let sound through when the signal strength is more than 
S3. Otherwise, the speaker will remain silent. 
 
Multi-function Adjustment Knob (from F/W version 1.75 onwards). 
The multi-function knob has several functions than can be customized. 
 
By default, turning the knob will tune the radio in 100kHz frequency 
steps. (this is the most common use) 
 
However, a momentary press of the knob allows adjustment of the 
receiving filter. 
 
Giving the Multi-Function knob a longer press, enters the user defined 
functions menu.  
 
 
Multi-function

Once in the user defined functions menu turn either the multi-function knob or 
the main tuning dial to go to one of the following functions: 
1
Freq 100k 
Frequency stepping value
2
SQL level 
Muting level setting 
3
PO Level 
Transmitter output power 
4

Automatic keyer rate 
5
FFT Scale 
Spectrum reference level 
When you are on the function you want to adjust e.g. squelch, momentarily 
press the multi-function knob in again. This will take you back to the normal 
operating screen. As soon as the receive screen is displayed rotate the multi-
function knob and where the bandwidth icon is normally displayed on the 
screen, the available values for the selected function available will be displayed 
as you turn the knob. When you have the value displayed that you wish to have, 
momentarily press the multi-function knob again to keep the value. 
 Note: If you wait too long you will be put into DSP filter adjustment mode. If this 
happens, start again. 
Reception and Transmission Operations using SPL and 
VFOA/B 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The G90/S transceiver has two built-in, independent, VFOs which can be set to 
different frequencies and different modes.  Using the SPL (split) function, you 
can transmit and receive on different frequencies or even bands. 
 
VFO operation

VFO setting: 
1. Momentarily press the [A/B / A>B] button to switch between VFO-A and VFO-
B; 
2. Set the required VFO frequency and mode when on one VFO (A or B). 
Split Operation (SPL); 
1. Set the required receive frequency and mode on VFO-A first; 
2. Then set the transmitting frequency and mode on VFO-B; 
3. Press the function button, then the [AGC/SPL] button to turn on the SPL (split) 
function.  The double-triangular icon will display between VFO-A and VFO-B on 
the VFO area of the screen. 
♦ As well as using them for split mode VFOA/B can simply be used to set two 
different simplex frequencies and modes so you can quickly switch between the 
two in real time. 
Automatic Gain Control (AGC) 
Select the appropriate AGC time constant for the best receiving experience: 
1. Momentarily press the AGC button at the bottom of the screen to cycle 
through the three AGC selections: 
AGC-S  AGC-F  AGC-A  AGC -- 
AGC-S: Slow AGC control 
Recommended 
settings: 
AM mode: AGC-S 
AGC-F: Fast AGC control 
 
CW AGC-F 
 
 
 
SSB: AGC-S 
AGC-A: Automatic AGC control 
 
AGC 
AGC OFF 
 
See below:
2. When the AGC-A mode is selected, the radio will automatically select the 
appropriate AGC control parameter depending upon the current mode. 
■ As of firmware version 1.73 with the AGC disabled, the receiver will have its 
RF gain automatically set to 25% so that noise received is not significantly 
increased. 
NOTE:  
You should experiment with the AGC Off mode only if the received signal is not 

============================================================

============================================================

 
29 
changing in strength due to fading (QSB). You must manually control the RF 
gain level so that you do not have distortion from the incoming signal 
overloading the receiver. Set AGC to “off”, then go into the RF gain setting (Hold 
the AGC button in for 2 seconds) then adjust the main knob until the signal 
sounds clear. This can result in a nice improvement of signal quality under good 
receiving conditions, especially for weak signals!  
PRE-AMP/ATT (combined control) 
The pre-amplifier can improve reception of some weak signals in the higher 
frequency bands. These are normally the bands above 20 meters. When 
adjacent signals are de-sensing the listened to station applying the attenuator 
can help. This is normally on bands below 40m. 
1. Press the [PRE] button at the bottom of the screen in momentarily and the 
character P will appear on the top left corner of the screen indicating that the 
pre-amplifier is turned on. 
2. Press the [PRE] button again and the character A will appear on the top left 
corner of the screen, indicating that the attenuator is turned on. 
3. Press the [PRE] button again and no character will appear on the top left 
corner of the screen, indicating that neither preamp nor attenuator are engaged. 
■ The receiver is sensitive enough that under 18mhz, no improvement of the 
signal to noise ratio will occur with use of the pre-amp. To maintain the best 
reception performance, limit use of the pre-amp to bands above 20 meters. 
■ When the S meter displays that the received signal exceeds S9+20dB, turning 
on the attenuator is recommended to provide better reception. 
Pulse Interface Suppressor – Noise Blanker 
Pulse interference suppression can effectively eliminate some kinds of pulse 
noise, especially interference caused by automobile ignition systems. 
1. Press the [NB] button at the bottom of the screen momentarily to enter the 
NB function setting - and a corresponding menu will display on the screen where 
the DSP filter graphic normally is. 
2. Repeated momentary presses of the [NB] button will select the different NB 
function setting options. Rotate the main tuning knob to set these values. 
The NB function menu includes the following options: 
 
NBSW: NB operation switch ON/OFF. Default is OFF 

============================================================
PAGE 30
============================================================

 
30 
 
NB Level: setting of NB suppression level. 
 
NB Width: setting of NB suppression width 
■ Adjust the Level and Width while listening to the noise you want to suppress 
for best effect. 
■ Improper settings of the NB parameters will severely degrade reception.  
Do not turn the NB on unless you need to suppress pulse noise. 
Voice Compression CMP 
Voice compression can increase the average TX power output during phone 
communication so that communications are possible under poor conditions. 
1. Press the [CMP] button at the bottom of the screen in momentarily and the 
voice compression indicator (a microphone) will appear at the top of the screen. 
2. Press the [CMP] button again to disable voice compression. 
Use voice compression only when you need it, as all compression degrades 
transmitted audio quality slightly. When conditions are good, leave it off.  
CW (Morse Code) Communication 
You may use a CW key or an external keying unit. Insert the connector into the 
KEY port on the rear of the radio. (See Page 10 for the definition of the required 
plug wiring) 
1. Insert CW Key/Keyer into the KEY socket on the rear of the main unit; 
2. Press the [MODE] button to switch to CW (or CWR) mode; 
3. Enable the QSK function by pressing the [KEY] button until the function 
appears, also set the appropriate QSK time; 
4. The radio will key into transmit when the Morse code key is pressed. 
Practice mode 
You can use the G90/S as a CW code trainer using the following method: 
■ Disable the QSK function for the [KEY] function. Only the CW sidetone of the 
transceiver will be heard when using the CW key. Signals will not be transmitted. 
 
 

============================================================
PAGE 31
============================================================

CW automatic decoding 
A long press of the [KEY] button enables CW automatic decoding. Rotate the 
main tuning knob to fine tune the received signal until the indicator light A 
flashes in time with the code. Decoded CW text will appear at the bottom of the 
screen.  
■ Since the accuracy of the automatic decoding of Morse code is related to the 
received station’s CW accuracy, received signal quality, and frequency 
accuracy of the other radio, Auto CW decoding is only an addition to using your 
own ears for decoding. It can also be useful when learning Morse code.  
When using automatic CW decoding, for best results, the bandwidth of the 
receiving filter should be set to 300Hz. Also, adjust the keyer speed on the 
G90/S to approximately the speed of the incoming CW for the best decoding 
results. The G90/S’s CW decoder is capable of excellent performance when 
adjusted correctly. 
CW Keyer settings 
The [KEY] button function has settings required 
for normal CW 
communications. Press the key in momentarily to select, in turn: 
 
SPEED: automatic key rate setting 
 
M/L/R: settings of manual/ automatic left- and right-hand modes 
 
MODE: Iambic A/B mode setting 
 
QSK switch: turn QSK on or off 
 
QSK Time: QSK time setting 
 
Ratio: set the automatic key dot-and-dash interval ratio

To enter the second function of the [KEY] button press [FUNC] button and then 
[KEY] to select and set the following options. Once adjusted using the main 
tuning knob, press the KEY button again to exits the settings process. 
Options: 
 
CW Volume: sidetone volume setting 
 
T800Hz: sidetone tone frequency setting 
 
B500: CW receiving bandwidth setting (the default value is 500Hz) – 
set to 300 if using the automatic CW decoder function. 
SSB Voice Communication 
Plug the lead from the hand microphone into the MIC port on the right-hand side 
of the head unit. After inserting, the green indicator light on the hand microphone 
will light. 
1. Press the [MODE] button (< or >) on the top of the head unit to switch between 
LSB and USB mode. Ensure you do not select U-D or L-D. 
2. Use the second function (after [FUNC] button has been pressed) of the 
[POW] button for the following settings: 
1) MIC GAIN: set the level of the hand microphone audio  
2) INPUT: select where the audio input comes from (the default is MIC and 
this is required during voice communications). 
3. A momentary press of the [POW] button allows you to set the output power 
level.: 
1) POWER: Set the required PEP output level (range is 1W - 20 W). 
2) SWR THR: set the standing-wave-ratio protection threshold (default is 3:1). 
If the radio sees an SWR over this value it will reduce power to protect itself. 
4. After you have set the parameters above you are ready for SSB 
communications. 
■ The default hand microphone voice gain value is appropriate in most cases. 
Watch the spectral display when transmitting and if you see extra lines above 
and below the main audio trace, reduce the mic gain or move away from the 
microphone until they disappear. Normally a setting of 10 is a good place to 
start. You should see the TX power readings peak at the level you set. The 
average meter indication will be lower. This is normal.  

============================================================

Voice-controlled Transmit - VOX 
The voice-controlled transmission (VOX) feature can automatically judge 
whether there is a hand microphone connected or if audio is coming from the 
line input signal (on the ACC socket). It will automatically control the radio 
switching between the receive and transmit when audio is detected. When the 
VOX function is activated, it is unnecessary to press the hand microphone PTT 
key to start the transmission. 
After pressing the [FUNC] button to activate the secondary functions of all 
buttons, press the volume knob IN and you will enter the VOX function settings. 
Rotate the main tuning knob to change values. Press the VOL knob in again to 
go through the different settings. 
 
VOX OFF/ ON: VOX function off / on 
 
VOX GAIN: voice control gain setting (recommended setting is 50) 
 
ANTI-VOX: echo suppression settings for the hand microphone in 
conjunction with the receiver speaker (recommended setting is 50) 
 
VOX DLY: VOX hang time (default is 0) 
■ The VOX voice-controlled TX function can be used with both the hand 
microphone and the line input. You can simply connect audio from your PC’s 
audio output and input lines to the rear ACC connector (or via the CE-19 
accessory) and the VOX function will handle switching the radio between TX 
and RX automatically without needing to have a transmit “PTT” control line. 
Setting Line level Input into ACC connector: 
When the AF-IN pin of the ACC interface is used for line input audio, (when 
using the U-D or L-D mode) you need to set the appropriate input volume in the 
"AUX IN Volume" option in the system menu. Set it at a mid-level value first. 
Then watch the TX power output and adjust your incoming audio from the PC. 
(using the PC’s sound card output volume level control). Remember that for 
digital data modes (e.g. FT8) you want to set the radio at about 50% of full 
output so as not to overheat the radio or distort the signal. With a good antenna, 
10W average output is sufficient for most digital mode communications. Keep a 
check on the temperature of the radio when you operate digital modes (and in 
general). Your ambient temperature might be 55F (12C) or 105F(40C) and this 
has a major effect on heat build-up. If the radio becomes very hot, you’ll need 
to reduce power and give it time to cool-down. The radio’s transmit section is 
very conservatively designed, but any radio can suffer from over-temperature 
under certain challenging operating conditions, such as the long 100% duty 
cycle periods of some digital modes.

Automatic Antenna Tuner 
The G90/S has an efficient ATU to help you quickly match many kinds of 
antennas effectively. 
1. Press the [TUNE] button in momentarily to bring the built-in antenna tuner 
into circuit. An antenna icon will appear at the top of screen. 
2. To initiate an antenna “tune”, hold the [TUNE] button for > 2 sec. 
Note: 
1. Pressing the (TUNE) button momentarily will show the antenna icon on the 
screen. This indicates that antenna tuner in in-line. If you need to tell the ATU 
to tune (new antenna, different frequency) hold the Tune button in for >2 sec.” 
Tuning” will be displayed. 
2. After the antenna is “tuned” (actually it is matched to the radio rather than 
“tuned”), leave the ATU ON so that it will provide the antenna match during 
operation. 
3. If the "SWR" icon is displayed at the top of the screen and flashes once while 
transmitting – even after tuning, this indicates that the standing-wave of current 
antenna is too high and while another tuning action may be attempted, this could 
also indicate a faulty antenna. 
4. When performing a tuning action via a long press of the Tune button, the 
tuner will go through its complete matching procedure and then return to receive 
mode after completion. (this may take several seconds) 
5. When your antenna is physically very close (e.g. a vertical mobile antenna), 
strong radio frequency interference may be caused to the radio or electronic 
equipment nearby. If this happens try to locate the antenna further away. 
Standing-wave Scanner SWR 
The G90/S has an antenna SWR scanning function. It can scan the standing-
wave values of the connected antenna to help you adjust the antenna. 
1. A long press of the [POW] button enables the standing-wave scanning 
function. It will scan the SWR of the antenna currently connected. 
2. Press the button below the BW label on the screen momentarily to switch the 
frequency step of the scan. 
3. At the bottom of the screen, the frequency of the lowest SWR point of the 
scanned standing wave is indicated. This is where the antenna is “resonant”. 

============================================================
PAGE 35
============================================================

 
35 
4. Press the button below the FAST/ SLOW label on the screen momentarily to 
select the scanning speed. 
5. Press the button below the QUIT label on the screen to exit the standing-
wave scanner. 
Corresponding location of keys VS. screen labels: 
(They are not perfectly aligned vertically) 
 
♦ The SWR scanner is for quick reference only and is not meant to replace a 
dedicated antenna analyzer. It is a very useful tool for trimming and adjusting 
an antenna when operating portable or for spotting a faulty antenna. 
Fine Tuning of Received Frequency (RIT) 
Sometimes a station will come back off-
frequency. Rather than tuning 
your 
frequency to the other station’s it’s better 
to add some “Receiver Incremental 
Tuning” to correct the other station’s frequency. 
1. A long press of the main tuning knob enters the RIT adjustment interface. 
2. Rotate the main knob left or right to adjust the RIT value. The adjustment 
range is ±500Hz.  
♦ When RIT is no longer required, reset the RIT value to 0. 

============================================================
PAGE 36
============================================================

Line Input and Output 
The G90/S has an external line input interface. When the G90/S is used for data 
communication in conjunction with a computer or an external modem, the 
correct signal input options need to be selected. 
1. Feed the external audio signal into the corresponding pin of the ACC port 
(see the interface description on page 10). 
2. Selecting the U-D or L-D mode, will automatically set the audio input to the 
radio to come from LINE input pin on the ACC socket. 
3. In the system menu, select: AUX IN VOLUM to set the appropriate input 
volume level. (see below) 
Operation of line output: 
In the system menu, select: AUX OUT VOLUM and set it to the appropriate 
output level. Your computer software package will have a meter showing best 
input levels. 
■ When using digital communications via the ACC port, the TX audio drive level 
should be capable of 200mv. 
■ The audio output level from the computer to the radio should be adjusted so 
that the ALC value displayed on the screen is between 30 and 85.  The lower 
the ALC value, the better. You should set the radio at your required output level 
and then adjust the PC’s sound card output so that the radio’s ALC is within 
range. Excessively high input signal level will overload the input amplifier, 
resulting in modulation signal distortion. With the ALC set correctly, the TX 
output reading may jump around rapidly under digital modes - but average 
power levels will be in the correct range for a clean and effective signal. Digital 
modes require much less TX power than other modes to make a contact. 
In the system menu, the following two settings are the ones to adjust for data 
communications: 
5 
AUXIN Volum 
Line input volume setting 
6 
AUXOUT Volum 
Line output volume setting 
♦ For digital data communications, the PC output level is adjusted together with 
the "Line input volume" (your TX audio) in the radio. The level of the audio input 
to the computer is adjusted in conjunction with the radio’s "Line output volume" 
(received audio going to the PC). The PC settings are normally found under 
“Sound   devices”. It is best to set the radio to a mid-level value and then adjust 
the PC’s levels to achieve correct operation. Fine tuning from that point can be 
done through the G90/S’s menu settings.

♦ It is always good to start with reduced TX power if you are unsure of your 
antenna’s condition or are new to the operation of your G90/S. Once you know 
your SWR is low and grounding is good, the radio is designed to operate at full 
power comfortably. 
Digital (DSP) Filters (from FW version 1.79b02 onwards) 
The G90/S has a built-in variable digital filter that can continuously adjust the 
bandwidth of the receiver’s input to improve reception of the desired signal  
With FW v 1.79b02 the G90 changed to an updated 2 BPF mode –The band-

Note: Negative numbers for frequency indicate that the frequency being 
used is to the left of the center of the spectrum (i.e. the lower sideband). 
 
Adjustment of the bandpass filters is now performed as follows:  
Put the radio in the required mode:  
▷ Short press the MFK button to switch between BPF1/BPF2 (colour 
changes slightly) 
▷ Turn the MFK encoder to adjust the selected BPF  
▷ Long press the MFK key or the FUNC key or any other menu key 
(POW, KEY, etc.) to exit the selection. 
  
Selecting the default filter to be used - press the FUNC button (light 
comes on):  
▷ Press CMP/F-L key to set BPF1 to be the default  
▷ Press NB/F-H key to set BPF2 to be the default  
Tip:  
▷ B2700 above the filter icon means that the bandwidth is set to 
2700Hz

Receive filter operation prior to firmware v 1.79b02: 
The G90/S has two filter adjustment modes: center frequency point mode and 
bandwidth mode. 
1. Press the [Multi-function] knob momentarily to switch between the two filter 
modes. 
2. When the center frequency point mode is selected: The prompt text "Cxxx" 
appears over the filter icon ("xxx" refers to the center frequency point value) and 
a green vertical line displays on the orange trapezoidal shape. 
3. When the bandwidth mode is selected: The prompt text "Bxxx" appears over 
the filter icon ("xxx" refers to the bandwidth value) and a green vertical line 
displays on the both sides of orange trapezoid. 
4. When either the center frequency point mode or the bandwidth mode is 
selected, rotating the [Multi-function] knob adjusts the values. 
Note: Press the multi-function button in once before adjusting by turning the 
multi-function knob and press the multi-function knob in again once the change 
is complete, to store the setting. (the vertical green bars go off once the setting 
is stored). 
How to adjust the low and high cut-off frequencies of the filter: 
1. Press the [FUNC] button momentarily to enable the operation of alternate 
button functions. 
2. Either press the [CMP/F-L] or [NB/F-H] button and rotate the main tuning 
knob to adjust the lower or upper cut-off frequencies of the filter. Press the 
[CMP/F-L] or [NB/F-H] button again momentarily to display the currently set 
bandwidth values in the function display area of the screen. 200/2750 is a good 
starting point for SSB operation. 
 
F-L: Adjust the low-end cutoff frequency of the filter 
 
F-H: Adjust the high-end cutoff frequency of the filter 
Method to reset to the default filter parameters: 
1. Press the [FUNC] button momentarily to enable the operation of the alternate 
button functions. 
2. Long press the [CMP/F-L] or [NB/F-H] button to reset the upper or lower cutoff 
frequencies of the filter to their default values. 
In the Center frequency mode (see above) you can move the center of the

bandpass filter around the current frequency to reduce interference from 
adjacent signals either above or below your operating frequency. 
♦ Properly adjusting the filter parameters can greatly improve the performance 
of the receiver as well as its sensitivity and signal to noise ratio. 
♦ In CW mode, the digital filter can be made as narrow as 50Hz but there will 
be obvious deterioration of the resulting audio at such an extremely narrow 
setting.  300-500 Hz is normally ideal. 
Spectrum/ Waterfall Display 
The G90/S radio can display the radio spectrum and waterfall diagrams of 
received signals and you can quickly observe whether there is a signal on the 
desired frequency of operation. You can also easily identify a clear frequency 
to QSY (move freq.)  to in case there is QRM (interference) occurring on the 
frequency you are currently using. 
Spectrum display bandwidth is 48kHz 
The spectrum signal strength value displays with an accuracy of ±2dB 
The sensitivity of the spectrum display (scale) can be adjusted for the conditions 
of the band you are operating on. If the scale is set too high, very strong signals 
may have their signal peaks cut off. You may adjust the scale by doing the 
following: 
1. Press the [FUNC] button momentarily and then the lock button, to enter the 
SCALE reference level setting. 
2. Rotate the main tuning knob to adjust the SCALE value until the display 
sensitivity is appropriate. 
3. Press the main tuning knob in momentarily to save and exit the setting 
screen. 
■ The SCALE reference values gradually increase from 1 to 10. When strong 
signals are observed, scale values need to be lowered. When looking at weak 
signals, the SCALE values can be increased. Generally, bands under 14 MHz 
will need less sensitive settings. 
■ The SCALE value in each frequency range can be set independently. 
The second function (with the FUNC button activated) of the [LOCK] button is 
as follows: 
 
SCALE: set the reference level setting 
 
AVE: set the average value setting 

============================================================
PAGE 41
============================================================

 
41 
AVE “average” values gradually increase from 1 to 10. The effect on the display 
is to smooth out rapid changes and provide a better representation of band 
activity. This setting is a matter of personal taste. It can improve usability of the 
spectrum display. 
Data Communication 
The G90/S supports all PC-generated amateur data communication modes and 
remote control via computer software when a PC is linked to the radio. Only 
simple wiring is needed to enable amateur data communications. The optional 
DE-19 digital interface allows one USB cable connection to your PC to handle 
both audio (data) traffic and serial control and is simpler than the process 
defined below. 
Version 1.79b02 firmware added the L-D and U-D (LSB-DATA and USB-DATA) 
modes which switch the bandpass filter and ensures audio input and output via 
the ACC socket only, disabling microphone audio.  
The appropriate transmission mode should be selected for the data mode in 
operation. The recommended modes for common data modes are as follows: 
Data mode 
Radio mode 
* For other data modes, set the 
radio mode to what is commonly 
used for that data mode.  
PSK31 
USB/USB-D 
RTTY 
LSB/LSB-D 
FT4/8 
USB/USB-D 
When an amateur radio and a computer communicate using digital data 
communication, the computer is used as a "modem" in that it converts the 
signals to and from digital tones. While receiving, the audio from the signal 
received is sent to the computer for demodulation. When transmitting, the audio 
signal created by the computer is sent to the radio for transmission. Thus, the 
computer’s audio output level effects the TX power output and ALC readings. 
The connections required are as follows: 
Receiving:  Received audio from the receiver→ computer audio IN 
Transmitting: The computer-generated audio signal → radio TX Audio IN 
Preparation: 
 For CAT command control of the radio from the PC you may use the supplied 
USB->3.5mm plug cable or the optional DE-19 interface unit. Before using the 
cable/unit for the first time, download and install the appropriate driver from the 
Radioddity website. When you then plug the cable into your Windows PC it will 
use this driver and not go off to search for an (incompatible) one from the Web.  

============================================================
PAGE 42
============================================================

 
42 
NOTE: currently a BLUE-USB plug equipped cable being supplied with the 
G90/S which uses FTDI chips in it to convert from serial-TTL to USB. Earlier a 
BLACK-USB plug cable using Prolific chips was supplied. You need to 
download the drivers related to the chipset in your cable from the Radioddity 
website. (Note if you use Linux or MAC rather than Windows, additional drivers 
for these operating systems are available at the FTDI website).   
 Although it is possible to connect using individual audio cables, the DE-19 
Interface unit (optional purchase) provides more convenient connections. 
 Adding a few snap-on ferrite RF chokes will protect against RF getting into 
the audio path. 
Cable connection steps 
1. AFTER INSTALLING THE DRIVERS ON THE PC. Insert the USB plug of the 
serial data cable or the DE-19 unit into the computer. Insert the 3.5mm plug of 
the cable or from the DE-19 into the communication port on the left side of the 
G90/S head unit only after the radio has been turned on. (If using a DE-19 
unit instead of the USB-serial cable, this can be connected before power on). 
2. Insert the 8-pin ACC cable provided with the DE-19 into the ACC port at the 
rear of the G90/S base unit and the other end into the corresponding port on 
the DE-19 (You can also use a CE-19 interface or make up your own direct 
audio lead ideally with some audio isolation). 
3.In the case of using the DE-19 unit, one end of the supplied USB cable plugs 
into the USB-C socket on the DE-19. The other end plugs into any of your PC’s 
USB-A sockets. 
NOTE: If you are not using a DE-19 or CE-19 unit you will need to provide a 
two-way audio path between your PC and the ACC socket on the G90. Older 
PCs may have separate 3.5mm audio out and audio in ports, more modern ones 
come with a single (4-connector) socket wired to take a smartphone type 
headset.  
4. Either select a data mode e.g. U-D (only after FW 1.79b02 or later has been 
installed). If using an older firmware level, you will have to set the G90/S to "Line 
input" mode (i.e. take the audio from the ACC socket rather than from the hand 
microphone.) and set the G90/S to the appropriate TX mode for the particular 
digital mode you are going to use. For most digital modes, that is USB. 
■ Remember to keep the PC audio (speaker) level output low and watch your 
ALC level when going onto transmit. Raise the PC output level until you see the 
ALC just start to respond...and then stop. TX power output will be lower than 

============================================================

============================================================

 
43 
the power set as the radio’s power output setting. This is so the signal is 
perfectly clean for digital operation and to avoid the radio overheating. This is 
normal procedure for digital modes. 
■ You can add clamp-on ferrite RF chokes to the USB data cable and the ACC 
cable if you experience any stray RF getting from the radio into the PC. For 
better performance, loop the wire through and then around and through the clip-
on ferrite choke again - then clamp it shut. Additional wire passes through the 
ferrite choke improve filtering. 
 
The USB-Serial port should be configured on your PC as 19200 bps, 8data bits, 
no parity, 1 stop bit.   
Digital Mode Connections 
 
 
When using the DE-19 one cable goes from the DE-19 to the PC’s USB port, one to the ACC 
port and one lead to the COMM port on the head unit.

Connecting the XPA125B amplifier to the G90/S (optional) 
The G90/S connects to the XPA125B power amplifier using the CE-19 or the 
newer DE-19 adapter. The XPA-125B’s antenna tuner is rated for full power 
output from the amplifier (at least 100w). 
 
Diagram of Wiring between G90 and XPA125B using a CE-19 or DE-19 unit 
Once connected, the G90/S can automatically control the band switching of the 
XPA125B. The transmit ALC connection is also handled via the CE-19 or DE-
19 adapter. If the G90/S output power exceeds the maximum input power to the 
XPA125B, the ALC control automatically decreases the G90/S’s output power 
to avoid over-driving the amplifier. 
The output power of the G90/S should be set to be ≤2.5W to protect the 
amplifier. The amplifier can give full output power with very little drive on the 
input socket. 
■ The 8-pin ACC wire is included with the CE-19 or DE-19 kit. The 6-pin ACC 
wire is included with the XPA125B to work with the CE-19 (an L-4001 cable is 
required for use the XPA125B with the DE-19). A coax patch lead is required to 
go from the G90/Ss output port to the amplifiers input port (user supplied) 
Factory Reset 
Factory Reset 
If the radio’s operation becomes abnormal in some way, you can restore the 
radio to the original factory settings. 
Operational steps: 
1. With the radio off, hold the FUNC button in and press the power button quickly 
on the radio to start the restoration of factory settings. 
2. Press the [PRE] button to confirm the reset. Press the [VM] button to cancel 
the operation. 
■ Default parameters can meet most operating needs. This is a good test to see 
if your radio is operating normally.

CiV Control Instructions 
Computer Control Instructions 
The G90/S uses a subset of the standard CiV CAT instruction set. You can 
remotely control the transceiver based on standard instructions or configure 
control instructions for other software. 
Here are the tables of commands that currently work. With later firmware 
changes, these could be added to or changed.

Note as at 23-05-2023, function 0x26/0x01 is not working correctly USB-D is 
reported as USB and LSB-D as LSB from the non-selected VFO. 
(enquiries to the currently selected VFO are working fine). 

============================================================

Although the G90 COMM connector looks the same as the ICOM Ci-V 
connector, there is a difference – the ICOM® connector is a 3.5mm mono 
connector and uses one wire for both Tx and Rx data. The XIEGU connector is 
a stereo plug with Rx and Tx data on separate rings of the plug. 
Band Voltage Data 
The ACC socket contains a “BAND” connection which indicates which band is 
selected by outputting a different voltage for each band. This voltage can be 
used to control peripherals that require automatic band switching.

Firmware upgrades 
 
Xiegu regularly releases firmware updates for the G90/S. Please go to 
radioddity.com and follow the Support link. All information for updating your 
G90/S will be there. The USB cable for performing updates is included with the 
G90/S or you can perform the upgrade via the (optional) DE-19 unit. Be sure to 
install the appropriate driver from the Radioddity website on your PC before 
inserting the USB cable into your PC. 
WARNING! When using the simple USB-Serial lead for connectivity 
between PC and radio, turning the radio on with the cable plugged into 
either the 3.5mm COMM sockets (in the head or main unit), can cause 
the radio to think you wish to update the firmware and you will have a 
radio that is non-operative and will have to perform a firmware update 
before you can use the radio again!! This problem does not occur when 
using the DE-19. 
Here is a list of the most recent improvements in the radio’s firmware: 
What’s new in v1.8 (12th May 2023) 
UPDATE DISP UNIT ONLY!! 
1. To work with JTDX/WSJTX (or some other data mode software), added CI-V 
commands 0x25,0x26. 
2. Add CI-V command 0x1d/0x19, read the XIEGU RADIO ID. 
What’s new in v1.79b03 (26th October 2022) 
Changes: 
1. Fix AM/NFM filter issue 
2. New colour map for waterfall 
What’s new in v1.79b02 (14th October 2022) 
1. Improved the AGC algorithm.  
2. Improved the Filter's algorithms.  
Additional functions/improvements: 
1. New data mode: U-D; L-D, for USB DIG; LSB DIG，  
In data mode: ACC port LINE IN is selected as audio in and the hand 
mic is muted; LINE OUT via the ACC socket is enabled  
2. The band-pass filter is changed to allow 2 BPF defaults that can be 
switched between. The default values of each filter by mode are:

4. When in any secondary menu the “FUNC” key now acts as a cancel 
button and the secondary menu will be exited without saving any data.  
5. FFT SCALE option is now fixed to AUTO  
6. Optimized the FFT automatic level algorithm, so that the visual 
effect is smoother 
What’s new in v1.78b01 (20th January 2022) 
This is an update to both the Main Unit and the Display Unit 
File: G90_MainUnit_FW_V1.78b01 
1. Fine tuning of AGC algorithm to improve audio quality 
2. Fix some issues of ALC algorithm 
   2.1 Tx power indicated more accurately 
   2.2 Fix the issue that ATU inaccurate or fails to tune 
 due to the instability of ALC algorithm 
3. AM Tx power equal to set power 
4. Display ALC level range as 0-100, 
    
Tips: 
   4.1 If ALC level is 0: you’re over driving, reduce the input signal level. 
   4.2 If ALC level is 100: you’re under driving, increase input signal level 
   4.3 When doing Digi-modes, the audio baseband signals are almost of 
         a constant amplitude, adjust the soundcard volume to set ALC level 
         between 20 and 80 to get good linearity 
5. Fixed a built-in keyer bug (had the chance of losing dot/dash when 
performing squeeze operation) 
File: G90_DispUnit_FW_V1.78b01 
1. Add CI-V command for ATU operation

 Improved the isolation of close to channels (increased by 
about 30dB).  
 Eliminated the impact noise of the speaker when switching 
between receiving and transmitting.  
 When connected to GSOC, all sounds in CW mode will be 
played by G90 speakers. If the modem function is turned on, 
the sound still will be played via the GSOC.  
Compatibility with GD MCU and ST MCU  
Note: G90 after the product serial number X04G211600001 must use the firmware 
version after V1.77 (including 1.77V), if it is updated to the firmware version before 1.77V, 
it may not work normally.

4. Widened the maximum bandwidth of CW filter 
5. Optimized the filter bandwidth/center frequency point adjustment 
and CW Tone adjustment range under CW mode 
– If CW Tone is adjusted under CW or CWR mode, the range of CW 
Tone is the upper and lower limits of filter under current mode 
– If CW Tone is not adjusted under CW or CWR mode, the range of 
CW Tone shall be within the upper and lower limits of filter under 
CW and CWR mode 
6. Changed RF GAIN to directly act on receiving channel 
gain Adjustment range: 1~100% (default: 50%), corresponding gain 
(on the basis of receiving channel gain): -19.6~+20dB, step=0.4dB 
– Note: RF GAIN will influence the value of Table S and FFT 
7. Added microphone filter of SSB mode to attenuate partial low 
frequency component of microphone signal and improve emission 
efficiency 
8. Changed the color of lines in frequency spectrum picture into green 
and fill color into semitransparent green 
9. Optimized the encoder to prevent it from interference or impulse as 
the first one 
10. Optimized stack and enhanced the stability 
11. Optimized the control characteristics of AGC and ALC 
12. Fixed the bug of channel storage function 
13. Fixed the spectrum display bug during emission 
14. Fixed the bug of standing wave detection threshold 
15. Fixed the problem of interrupted voice during low power emission

What’s new in v1.7.3 
1. Rotate encoder driver is optimized, smoother and less loss of step 
2. Total RF GAIN=1/4 RF GAIN setting when AGC is off, prevent 
sudden volume increase 
3. Rx volume step is optimized 
4. Lower the MIC GAIN, prevent picking up too much background 
noise 
What’s new in v1.7.2 (experimental version) 
1. CW timing is optimized, solved the issue of randomly losing 
DOT/DASH. 
2. T/R switch timing is optimized, faster switching time (t<=53ms). 
3. Add ALC meter, display below the TX power meter when TXing. It 
is mainly for digital mode, to get the good linearity. adjust driving 
level or Line IN volume to make the ALC meter value within 
30~90. Max level of Line IN should not be more than 600mVp-p, or 
it will overload the input amplifier. 
4. PO meter is optimized, more accurate. 
5. Rotate encoder driver is optimized, less losing of steps. 
6. ACC LINE OUT is optimized, main volume will not affect its output 
level anymore. 
7. ACC Band Voltage switching output is optimized, solved the issue of 
wrong voltage for 12m band. 
8. TS max digit change from 10k to 100k when pushing the main knob. 
9. RIT function added: Press and hold main knob to activate. 
What’s new in v1.7.1 
1. RF Gain Control: After a long press of the AGC button. Rotate the main 
VFO knob to change the RF gain (this does not affect the S meter or 
FFT scales). 
2. DSP Filter: A momentary press of the multi-function knob allows setting 
of the DSP center frequency and the bandwidth of the filter. 
3. 
FFT Averaging: Pressing the FUNC button and then the LOCK button 
opens the setting of the averaging function. Adjust it to your personal 
preference.
