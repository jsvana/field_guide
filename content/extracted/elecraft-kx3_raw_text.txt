Introduction 
On behalf of our entire design team, we’d like to thank you for choosing the Elecraft KX3. 
 
The KX3 is a compact, 160-6 meter, all-mode transceiver that’s ideal for both new and experienced 
operators. Its unique features meet the requirements for home station use, portable, mobile, and even 
hand-held operation. 
 
Since the KX3 is a software-defined-radio (SDR), you’ll be able to extend its capabilities using 
computer applications, and add new features via free firmware upgrades. But the KX3 is also the only 
compact transceiver that combines the flexibility of an SDR with a full-size front panel and display, 
allowing operation with or without a computer.  
 
Despite its small size, the KX3 can be configured as a fully self-contained amateur station, with an 
internal antenna tuner, battery charger, 2-meter or 4-meter module, and attached CW keyer paddle. 
These options can be added at any time. Current drain is also very low for a full-featured transceiver, 
reflecting our commitment to field operation. For mobile and home use, you can boost the KX3’s 
output to 100 watts with the optional KXPA100 amplifier. Finally, there’s the PX3 high-performance 
Panadapter, which enhances operation by allowing you to see signals even before you hear them. 
 
When it’s time to take on the challenge and adventure of amateur radio, your KX3 will be ready.

Installation  
 
  CAUTION 
§ 
Be careful when plugging in cables. Avoid 
applying sideways pressure that might damage 
the KX3’s left-side jacks. 
§ 
Avoid operating in wet conditions (rain, 
snow, spray, etc.). The KX3 is not waterproof. 
§ 
Avoid operating at very high temperatures.  
§ 
The KX3 can be damaged by electrostatic 
discharge (ESD). Prior to opening the case, 
touch a grounded, unpainted metal surface. 
 
Operating Position 
All controls are located on the top of the KX3’s 
enclosure. This provides ample space for controls 
and display, despite the transceiver’s small size.  
Tilt legs are provided in the back to position the 
controls and display for ease of use, as shown 
below. Loosen the two rear thumbscrews before 
adjusting the legs. Tighten them afterwards.  
 
  To open the enclosure, follow the 
instructions on pg. 23 (Internal Batteries). Use 
only the method shown. 
  The KX3 can be conveniently operated with 
one hand, in a manner similar to writing in a 
notebook. If you’re right-handed, rotate the radio 
slightly counter-clockwise (see cover illustration). 
If you’re left-handed, rotate the KX3 clockwise. 
Power Supply 
For fixed-station use, a low-noise 12-14 VDC 
power supply or battery is recommended. (See 
linear and switching power supplies in the 
Glossary, pg. 52.) For lightweight portable 
operation, the KX3’s internal 8-AA-cell battery 
pack can be used. See Internal Batteries, pg. 23.  
  Maximum power output varies with supply 
voltage and other parameters. For full power       
(10+ watts on most bands), use 12-14 V. 
Connect an external power supply or battery to the 
9-15 VDC jack (see illustration below). The center 
pin is (+). A 2.1-mm power plug is required 
(Switchcraft S760 or equivalent). On the supplied 
power cable assembly, the wire with the white 
stripe is (+).  Trim the cable to the desired length.  
 
 
CW Key/Keyer Paddle  
The KX3 has two CW keying inputs: 
KEY Jack: This stereo 3.5 mm jack on the left side 
can be used with any hand key, keyer paddle, or 
other keying device, as selected by the CW KEY1 
menu entry (see Using the Menu, pg. 9). 
  A stereo plug is required at the KEY jack, 
even if only the tip contact is being used, as with 
a hand key. 
KXPD3 Keyer Paddle: The KXPD3 is an optional 
high-quality keyer paddle that attaches at the front 
of the KX3 via two thumb screws. The dot and dash 
paddles can be electrically reversed or configured 
as a hand key using the CW KEY2  menu entry. 
Allen wrenches are supplied for contact adjustment.

  Avoid using bulky connectors or adapters 
that could put excessive stress on side-panel 
jacks. Lightweight cables, preferably with right-
angle plugs, are strongly recommended.  
 
Headphones and Speakers 
The 3.5-mm PHONES jack, on the left side panel, 
accommodates mono or stereo headphones. You 
can also plug in one or two amplified (or powered) 
external speakers here. Mono or stereo plugs can be 
used. Stereo allows the use of audio effects, 
providing an enhanced listening experience (pg. 
29).  
The KX3 includes a small built-in speaker for use 
in quiet operating environments. Plugging in 
headphones disables the speaker and its amplifier. 
(This is an easy way to extend battery life.) 
Mobile installations:  The interior of most vehicles 
is too noisy for use with the KX3’s built-in speaker. 
One or two amplified mobile speakers can be 
plugged into the PHONES jack, or you can connect 
this jack to your car stereo’s AUX input. Another 
alternative is to use a device that retransmits the 
KX3’s audio output in the FM broadcast band.  
Microphone 
The MIC jack is compatible with the Elecraft MH3 
hand mic, which provides PTT as well as VFO 
UP/DN buttons. For the MH3, set the MIC BIAS 
menu entry to ON, and MIC BTN to PTT UP.DN.  
 
MH3 Mic Pinout 
Sleeve:  Shield 
Ring2:  Logic ground 
Ring1:  PTT/UP/DN 
Tip:      Mic audio 
Using other microphones and headsets: The KX3 
is compatible with many headset-mics that have 
separate 3.5-mm plugs for mic audio and receive 
audio. You can also use some “mini” mics intended 
to plug directly into a laptop computer. Refer to the 
MIC BIAS and MIC BTN menu entries to set up 
the KX3 for use with your mic or headset. 
Computer/Control Port (ACC1) 
The 3.5-mm stereo ACC1 jack allows firmware 
updates, configuration, and remote control of the 
KX3 via a computer. The jack can be connected to 
a computer’s USB port via the Elecraft model 
KXUSB cable, or to an RS232 port via the model 
KXSER cable. (The jack’s tip connection is RX 
data from the computer. Ring is TX data to the PC.) 
Elecraft provides two KX3 configuration programs: 
KX3 Utility is required for KX3 configuration and 
firmware updates (pg. 25). It also provides a 
CW/data terminal function.  
Our K3 Memory PC application can be used with 
the KX3 to set up frequency memories more easily 
than with the radio’s memory-store function. 
Many logging, contesting, and control programs are 
available from third parties. If the KX3 is not 
specifically supported by a given program, try 
selecting Elecraft K3 or K2. 
  
Keyline Out and GPIO (ACC2) 
The 2.5-mm stereo ACC2 jack provides a keyline 
output (ring contact) and a general-purpose 3-volt 
logic signal (tip contact).  
The keyline output goes low during transmit, and 
can be used for transmit/receive switching of linear 
amplifiers and transverters. For keyline voltage and 
current limits, see Specifications. 
The general-purpose signal, GPIO, can be set up for 
various equipment control functions. For example, 
it can send band-change information to Elecraft 
XV-series transverters. See the ACC2 IO menu 
entry for a full list of uses for this signal, as well as 
hardware interface requirements. 
Quadrature Outputs (RX I/Q) 
The 2.5-mm RX I/Q jack provides quadrature 
outputs from the receive mixer (I=in-phase; 
Q=quadrature, or 90 degrees out of phase). These 
outputs can be used with the Elecraft PX3 
Panadapter, as well as with computer-based 
software-defined radio (SDR) programs, to extend 
the capabilities of the KX3.  See SDR Applications 
(pg. 26).

Antennas 
You can use any resonant antenna having a 50-ohm 
(approximate) load impedance with the KX3. 
Examples can be found in the ARRL Antenna 
Handbook and other sources. A simple inverted “V” 
or dipole can be very effective.  
Antenna jacks:  The BNC antenna jack, identified 
at right, is used on 160-6 m. The SMA jack shown 
is supplied with the KX3-2M/4M module (pg. 25). 
The basic KX3 has a hole plug at this location. 
Field Antennas:  Field operation often calls for 
non-resonant, ad-hoc wire antennas. For example, 
you might use a single wire of 25’ (7 m) or longer, 
tossed in a tree using a fishing weight or large hex 
nuts. Another popular field antenna is the short, 
loaded whip with interchangeable loading coils. 
  If you use a short whip, vertical, or a single 
wire, a counterpoise of some kind is necessary 
(described at right) to carry the return current. No 
counterpoise is needed for a dipole, since one half 
of the diplole carries return current.  
SWR: One measure of how close an antenna is to 
resonance is its SWR (standing wave ratio). The 
KX3 displays SWR in TUNE mode (pg. 14). An 
SWR of 1.0:1  (1.0-1 on the KX3’s display) is 
considered a “perfect” match. To ensure safe 
operation, the KX3 reduces power if SWR is high. 
Using An Antenna Tuner (ATU):  An ATU will 
allow the KX3 to “see” a good match (i.e., a low 
SWR) even with non-resonant antennas. This 
allows the transmitter to deliver full power, and can 
improve receiver sensitivity. An ATU may also 
allow one antenna to be used on multiple bands. 
You can use an external ATU (e.g., an Elecraft T1 
or KXAT100) or internal (e.g., the KXAT3 option, 
pg. 25). The KXAT3 stores matching information at 
multiple points within each band. 
Feedline: You can connect a wire antenna directly 
to the KX3 without any coax or other feedline. (A 
male BNC to binding-post adapter can be used, 
such as Elecraft #BNC-BP.) However, many 
antennas will function better when their feed point 
is well above ground. A multi-band, random-length 
antenna can be fed with twin-lead, then connected 
to a balun (balanced-to-unbalanced converter, such 
as the Elecraft BL1 or BL2), which in turn is 
connected directly to the transceiver. 
Grounding and ESD Protection 
Connecting the chassis to a driven ground rod can 
provide some protection against lightning and 
damage due to electrostatic discharge (ESD). When 
used in a building, the rod should also be bonded to 
other building grounds. Connect the ground (or a 
counterpoise for a whip or single-wire antenna) to 
the KX3 at the thumb screw indicated below, on the 
right side panel. The back thumb screw on the left 
side can also be used. 
 
 
 
Portable Station Ground: When you’re operating 
from a temporary location, you can use one or more 
radials as a counterpoise. This can simply be a set 
of wires tied together at one of the KX3’s ground 
points, then laid out on the ground in all directions. 
When possible, use at least one 1/4- wavelength 
radial for each band used. The length in feet can be 
calculated from 234 divided by F, where F is the 
operating frequency in MHz. If the wires are laying 
on the ground, subtract about 20% from their 
length. Random-length (untuned) counterpoise 
wires can also be used when necessary. 
Pedestrian Mobile Ground:  The KX3 can be 
operated hand-held—even while walking—with a 
short whip antenna. Such antennas may provide 
acceptable performance in receive mode without a 
ground. However, if you plan to transmit, you’ll 
need a trailing ground wire to serve as a minimal 
counterpoise and greatly improve your transmitted 
signal. This is true even if the KX3 indicates a low 
SWR in TUNE mode (without a counterpoise, the 
SWR reading can be misleading). 13’ is a good 
choice for a trailing ground wire. This length is 
about optimum on 20 meters, and is usable on 40-6 
meters as well, assuming you’re using a multi-band 
whip (or an antenna tuner). Small-diameter coax 
such as RG-174 works well for a trailing wire 
because it resists getting tangled while you walk.

Basic Operation 
This section describes basic KX3 controls and 
features. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you’ll be 
ready to explore the Advanced Operating 
Features section (pg. 17), which covers built-in 
text decode, frequency memories, dual watch and 
other topics.  
 
Getting Started 
Before using the KX3, you’ll need to connect a 
power supply and an antenna, at minimum. See 
Installation (pg. 4) for more details. 
Turning the KX3 On/Off 
To turn the KX3 on or off, press and hold the 
BAND- and ATU TUNE switches simultaneously 
for about two seconds, then release. Left side 
labeling identifies these two switches (see below). 
This power on/off method reduces the likelihood of 
accidental activation in a backpack or carrying case. 
  Always turn the KX3 off as described above 
before turning off or disconnecting any external 
power source. This will ensure that your current 
VFO settings, etc., are saved. 
 
 
Switch  TAP  and  HOLD  Functions 
All KX3 switches have two functions: 
§ 
Tap to activate the function labeled on a switch, 
e.g. RATE  
§ 
Hold for about 1/2 second to activate the 
function labeled below a switch, e.g. KHZ 
AF Gain and other Knob Functions 
Each of the four small knobs has a primary function 
that is in effect when you turn on the KX3. For 
example, the knob at far left,  
 AF / RF-SQL, 
normally controls receiver AF gain (volume). As 
you rotate this knob, the AF gain setting is 
displayed in the VFO B area.  
Tapping this knob briefly switches to its secondary 
function, RF gain (squelch in FM mode). Holding 
the knob—pushing it for over 1/2 second—switches 
to a third function,  
 MON  (volume setting for 
transmit monitor and switch tones).  
The small knobs are also used in conjunction with 
nearby switches. For example, if you tap DISP, 
rotating the knob directly above it (OFS / VFO B) 
will scroll through several special displays, 
including time, supply voltage, current drain, etc. 
Using the Menu 
The menu is used to tailor the transceiver to your 
operating preferences. 
To access the menu, hold  MENU until the          
BKLIGHT (LCD brightness) menu entry appears in 
the VFO B area. The parameter, in this case the 
brightness level, appears in the VFO A area.  
To change the value of a menu parameter, rotate 
VFO A (large knob). In the case of BKLIGHT, 
rotating the knob will select backlight ON or OFF. 
To scroll through menu entries, use the small 
knob above the menu switch, 
 OFS/VFO B.  
To exit the menu, hold  MENU again. 
  While in the menu, holding  MENU  for about 3 
seconds displays usage information about the 
present menu entry. Tap any switch to cancel. 
Configuration Menu Functions 
Now that you know how to use the menu, you may 
wish to review the Configuration section (pg. 29) 
to make sure the KX3 is configured properly for 
your installed options and operating preferences. 
There are also a number of calibration steps 
performed on your KX3 at the factory (for both kits 
and assembled radios). See Calibration, pg. 31.

Mode Selection 
Each mode is described briefly below. Later 
sections cover each mode in detail.  
Tap MODE one or more times to select SSB, CW, 
AM, or FM mode.  ALT selects alternate modes, 
such as CW reverse. Tap  DATA  to select data 
mode. To select a data sub-mode, tap  DATA again, 
then rotate  
 OFS/VFO B.   
SSB (single sideband, pg. 15) is a narrow-banded 
voice mode that conserves space in crowded band 
segments. It’s the most popular mode overall. LSB 
(lower sideband) is usually used on 160, 80, and 40 
meters, while other bands use USB (upper 
sideband). You can override the default using ALT.  
CW mode (pg. 16) uses on-off keying of the 
carrier. CW requires very little bandwidth, 
providing a high signal-to-noise ratio that’s ideal 
for low-power (QRP) use. It’s also a popular mode 
for DXing and contests. Holding ALT switches to 
CW REV (CW reverse), reversing the received 
sideband in CW mode from LSB to USB. This may 
reduce the level of interference (QRM). 
AM mode (amplitude modulation, pg. 15) is 
characterized by its good fidelity . It is much less 
power-efficient than SSB. AM amateur operation is 
often found on 160, 80, 40, and 10 meters. 
FM mode (frequency modulation, pg. 15) is most 
often used for local communications, and can be 
found on 10 m and up (see ARRL band plan). The 
KX3 supports simplex and repeater operation, 
including tone encoding. Many repeaters can be 
found on the 2-m band (144-148 MHz), which is 
covered by the KX3-2M option module (pg. 25). 
  If you don’t plan to operate in AM or FM 
modes, you can turn them off individually using the 
AM MODE and FM MODE menu entries (pg. 35).  
DATA modes (Advanced Operating Features, pg. 
18) typically use a computer connected to the 
transceiver to send/receive text. Although SSB 
modes can also be used for this purpose, the KX3’s 
audio-based data modes (DATA A and AFSK A) 
optimize settings for data rather than voice. 
The KX3 also has two built-in data modes that 
don’t require a computer: FSK D (narrow-shift 
RTTY) and PSK D (PSK31). These modes use the 
KX3’s display for receive, and a keyer paddle for 
transmit, converting the CW you send into data.

VFOs A and B 
The KX3 provides two VFOs (see glossary, pg. 52). 
Use of VFO B is optional. The VFO knobs are 
located in the area shown below. Each VFO has 
independent frequency, mode, and filter settings.  
 
VFO A normally controls both the receive and 
transmit frequency. Most contacts occur between 
stations tuned to about the same frequency, so if 
you use VFO A to tune in a signal clearly, there’s a 
good chance they’ll hear you when you transmit. 
VFO B can serve as a holding register for a second 
frequency of interest, then swapped with VFO A as 
needed (see A / B at right). To tune VFO B 
directly, first make sure the B LED above the knob 
is lit. If not, tap the  
 OFS/VFO B knob. Also see 
SPLIT (pg. 19) and Dual Watch (pg. 20). 
Tuning rates: Tapping  RATE  selects either 1 Hz 
or 10 Hz VFO tuning rate. Holding  KHZ selects a 
per-mode coarse tuning rate (see MENU:VFO 
CRS, pg. 30). SSB stations often align on 0.5 or 1.0 
kHz boundaries. AM broadcast stations are 
typically spaced at 5, 9, or 10 kHz. 
To lock VFO A: Hold KHZ for about 3 seconds. 
Tap RATE to unlock. To lock VFO B, swap it with 
VFO A first, lock it, then swap back. 
  You can use the  
 OFS/VFO B  control to 
tune VFO A in coarse steps, while the VFO A 
control itself is still set up for fine steps. First, make 
sure the OFS LED is lit (tap the 
 OFS/VFO B 
knob one or two times). RIT and XIT (described at 
right) must also be turned off. To disable the VFO 
offset-tuning feature, see MENU:VFO OFS. 
To copy VFO A’s frequency to VFO B: Tap          
A 
 B. Tapping a second time copies VFO A’s 
mode and filter settings to VFO B as well.
VFO A and B swap: Tap  A / B to exchange VFO 
frequencies, modes, and all other settings.  
VFO A/B temporary reverse: Sometimes you’ll 
want to swap the VFOs temporarily to look for an 
open transmit frequency when operating split (pg. 
19). In this case, hold REV. The VFOs will be 
swapped back as soon as you release the switch. In 
FM mode, REV swaps receive/transmit frequencies 
and the repeater offset direction (pg.15). 
Incremental Tuning (RIT and XIT) 
RIT, or receive incremental tuning, provides a 
means of adjusting the receive frequency without 
affecting your transmit frequency. This control is 
sometimes called a clarifier since it can be used to 
tune in SSB voice signals. But RIT can also be used 
in CW and DATA modes, in the event that a station 
calls you slightly off-frequency. RIT and XIT use 
the tuning rate (1/10 Hz) selected for the VFOs. 
XIT, or transmit incremental tuning, adjusts the 
transmit frequency without affecting the receive 
frequency. See Split and XIT, pg. 19. 
∆ F (Delta-F) LED 
:  Whenever an RIT or XIT 
offset is in effect, or during split operation, the ∆ F 
LED turns on as a reminder that your receive and 
transmit frequencies are different. 
To use RIT or XIT: First, tap  RIT  or  XIT . This 
turns on the RIT or XIT icon on the display, as well 
as the OFS LED (above  
 OFS/VFO B ). Then 
adjust the offset using  
 OFS/VFO B . 
To zero the RIT/XIT offset: Hold CLR. 
  You can still use the  
 OFS/VFO B  control 
to tune VFO B, even if RIT or XIT is turned on. 
Just tap the knob to switch its function back to VFO 
B (the B LED will turn on). The RIT/XIT icons on 
the LCD will retain their current states. 
 
Special VFO B Displays 
The VFO B display area can show several useful 
parameters. To see these, tap  DISP , then rotate the               
 OFS/VFO B  control. This will cycle through 
several displays including time, supply voltage, 
current drain, power amplifier temperature, 
synthesizer temperature, audio voltmeter, and 
relative audio (dBV) meter. For details see pg. 22.

Receive Settings 
The RX control group, shown below, is used to set 
up the KX3’s receiver. Directly above these 
controls is the filter passband graphic, which shows 
the shape and position of the receiver’s passband. 
This determines what pitch range you’ll hear.  
 
AF Gain, RF Gain, and Squelch 
The 
 AF / RF-SQL  knob normally controls 
receiver AF gain. Tapping the knob switches its 
function to squelch (FM mode only) or RF gain 
(all other modes). Also see “AF, RF, and IF” in the 
glossary (pg. 52). 
RF gain is normally left at maximum  (-0 dB). 
Reducing RF gain may be useful in some strong-
signal conditions. If you reduce RF gain more than 
a few dB, a separate segment of the S-meter turns 
on as a reminder. The segment used varies with the 
amount of RF gain reduction.  (A high S-meter 
reading may hide the RF gain indicator segment.) 
Squelch is used to mute the receiver until a signal 
appears. It is most often used with repeaters. The 
control adjusts the signal threshold required for 
squelch to “open,” unmuting the receiver. 
Voice Monitor/CW Sidetone Level (MON) 
Holding  
 AF / RF-SQL  temporarily switches its 
function to 
 MON , which controls how much of 
your own signal you hear when transmitting. 
Transmit monitor setup is covered on pg. 14. 
  Switch activation tones, if used, have the same 
volume level as the CW sidetone (as set in CW 
mode using 
 MON ). Switch tones can be set to 
off, on, or Morse code characters at various speeds 
using the SW TONE menu entry. 
Passband Tuning Functions (PBT I/II) 
The 
 PBT I/II  control is used to shape the KX3’s 
receive filter passband. In general, a narrow 
passband reduces interference (QRM) and noise 
(QRN), while a wider passband improves fidelity.  
In voice modes, tapping  
 PBT I/II  normally 
selects low-cut (function I) or high-cut (function 
II). These functions remove low- or high-pitched 
interfering signals. Examples of filter graphic 
segments that might turn off as the result of a low-
cut or high-cut are shown in light gray below. (To 
select width/shift for SSB, instead, use PBT SSB.) 
              Low-Cut 
             High-Cut 
      
 
I
       
 II
 
In CW and DATA modes, the passband functions 
are width (I) and shift (II). The effect of these 
functions is illustrated below. Reducing the width 
or shifting the passband may attenuate an 
interfering signal above or below the desired one.  
                 Width                                Shift 
       
 
I
        
 II
 
Holding  
 PBT I/II  normalizes the passband 
(NORM), centering it and setting it to the default 
width for the current mode. Two small "anchors" 
appear at the left and right ends of the graphic. 
Holding NORM again restores the previous 
passband settings. 
 
Roofing Filters (XFIL) 
The XFIL icons, to the right of the filter passband 
graphic, show whether the optional roofing filters 
(FL2, FL3) are in use. These filters, located on the 
KXFL3 option module, can reject strong nearby 
signals that might interfere with weaker ones. 
When FL1 is indicated, the roofing filters are 
bypassed, and the pre-DSP bandwidth is about 15 
kHz. FL2 (3000 Hz) and FL3 (1000 Hz) are 
automatically selected, when possible, based on the 
operating mode and settings of the filter controls.  
Dual watch (MENU:DUAL RX) also uses FL1, 
overriding the normal per-mode filter selection. 

============================================================
PAGE 13
============================================================

 
 
 
13 
 
 
Preamp and Attenuator 
PRE turns on the RF preamp. It should be used 
only when signals are very weak. Preamp gain can 
be set on a per-band basis using MENU:PREAMP. 
ATTN turns on the 15-dB RF attenuator, which can 
protect the receiver from strong interfering signals.  
  The KX3 will automatically reduce receive gain 
in the presence of very strong signals. The receive 
overload icon (RX) will alert you to this (pg. 8). 
Noise Reduction 
Noise reduction (NR) removes random background 
noise (hiss or static). It has a characteristic “hollow” 
sound. Higher settings may attenuate weak signals. 
Holding NR turns on noise reduction and displays 
its setting, which can be adjusted using the knob 
above the switch. Tap any switch to exit the setting 
display. Hold NR again to turn noise reduction off. 
Noise Blanking 
Noise blanking can eliminate repetitive noise such 
as that from power lines, appliances, and vehicle 
ignitions systems. Use the lowest effective setting 
to avoid unwanted signal/noise interaction. 
NB turns on the noise blanker. The NB setting is 
adjusted in the same way as NR (see above). 
Audio Peaking Filter (APF) 
APF turns on a very narrow filter that improves 
copy of very weak CW signals buried in noise. The 
filter graphic changes to that shown below. With 
APF on, PBT function I still adjusts the overall 
passband width; function II tunes the APF center 
pitch. 1-Hz VFO tuning is automatically selected. 
 
 
Notch Filtering 
In CW and data modes, holding NTCH turns on a 
manually adjusted notch filter and displays the 
notch pitch. Adjust the pitch, using the knob above 
the switch, until an interfering carrier is reduced in 
volume. Tap any switch to exit the notch pitch 
display. Hold NTCH again to turn it off.  
In SSB and AM modes, NTCH turns on auto-notch, 
which locates and suppresses one or more carriers 
automatically. 
CW/DATA Tuning Aid (CWT) 
Accurate tuning of received signals is required 
before you call a station, or when you’re using 
built-in text decode (TEXT, pg. 16). Tuning can be 
done by ear. But CWT, in conjunction with Auto-
SPOT (below), can often tune in stations for you. 
When you hold CWT , the upper half of the S-meter 
becomes a receive VFO tuning aid for CW and 
some data modes.  
A CW signal will appear as a single bar in the CWT 
display, as shown in the left example below. Use 
VFO A to tune in the signal until the bar directly 
under the CWT pointer is turned on. A narrow filter 
width is recommended (100-400 Hz). This display 
also applies to PSK31 (PSK D, pg. 18). 
        CW and PSK31                          RTTY 
    
        
 
In RTTY or radioteletype modes (FSK D, AFSK A; 
pg. 18) mark and space tones are represented by 
three bars on either side of the CWT pointer. If no 
RTTY signal is present, you’ll see the “ghosting” 
effect shown above. As you tune in an RTTY 
signal, the number of solid bars will increase. Keep 
tuning until you see a rough balance between left 
and right solid bars during an RTTY transmission.  
SPOT and Auto-SPOT 
You can use SPOT to manually tune in a CW or 
PSK31 signal, matching it to your sidetone pitch. 
First turn off CWT if it is on. Then, tap SPOT and 
adjust VFO A until the signal pitch matches the 
sidetone. Use  
 MON  to adjust the sidetone 
volume level. 
To use auto-SPOT: First turn on CWT . Tapping 
SPOT will then automatically tune in a received 
signal that falls within the CWT display range.  
  If RIT is turned on, auto-SPOT will change 
the RIT offset, not the VFO A frequency. 
  Auto-SPOT may not be usable if more than one 
signal is in the CWT range, or if the signal is very 
weak or noisy. Try using a narrower bandwidth in 
this case.

Transmit Settings 
The TX control group is used to set up the KX3’s 
transmitter. The TX LED turns on during transmit. 
  Caution:  Also follow the detailed TX setup 
instructions in later sections for each mode. 
 
Keyer Speed/Mic Gain and Power Output 
In CW mode,  
 KEYER/MIC  sets the keyer speed 
(in WPM). In voice modes, it sets mic gain.  
A hold of this knob selects  
 PWR  (power out). 
Power in watts is shown on the RF bar graph.  
Power output is typically 10 W+ on 160-15 m, and 
8 W+ on 12-6 m. The 6-m setting is independent. 
If a KXPA100 amp is connected, power can be set 
up to 110 W (see KXPA100 owner’s manual). 
  Maximum available power output varies. If 
power is lower than expected, use the special VFO 
B displays (pg. 11) to check supply voltage, current 
drain, and PA temperature. The selected parameter 
will be shown on VFO B during TUNE (SWR is 
shown on VFO A). A reduced-current TX mode is 
automatically used when possible. This is indicated 
by a decimal point after the “W” (e.g. 3.0 W.). 
Other Transmit Settings 
Hold  
 MON  to set the transmit monitor volume 
(speech in voice modes, sidetone in CW mode).  
CMP  sets the amount of speech compression, 
which increases average power output, making your 
voice sound louder. Adjust compression using the 
knob above the switch; to finish, tap  CMP again. 
PITCH  sets the sidetone pitch in CW mode, and 
the tone-encode pitch in FM mode (pg. 15). Mark 
or center pitch is shown in some data modes. 
DLY  sets the VOX (voice-operated transmit) delay 
time in voice modes (pg. 15). In CW mode, DLY 
sets the break-in or QSK delay (pg. 16). 
VOX selects the keying mode: PTT (push-to-talk) 
or VOX (voice- or keying-operated transmit). With 
PTT selected, the transmitter is enabled by tapping 
XMIT or by holding the mic’s PTT button. With 
VOX selected, the VOX icon turns on, and transmit 
starts by speaking (voice modes) or when keyed 
(CW mode). Also see DLY (at left) and 
MENU:VOX GN (p. 35). 
Transmit and ATU Control 
The switches in the group shown below perform 
various transmit control functions. 
 
MSG and REC play/record messages (pg. 16, 21). 
ATU TUNE starts automatic antenna matching if a 
KXAT3 internal ATU is installed (pg. 25).  The 
ATU MD menu entry must be set to AUTO mode. 
Matching takes an average of 4 seconds, initially. 
Settings are then recalled instantly on band change, 
as well as when you transmit after moving the VFO 
a significant distance. The ATU icon will flash 
briefly whenever new L-C network settings are 
recalled. In CW mode, recall of settings is delayed 
until a brief pause in keying (about 0.5 seconds). 
  With difficult loads, tap ATU TUNE a second 
time within 5 seconds to search for a lower SWR. 
ANT controls ANT1/2 selection on the KXAT100 
external ATU.  ANT does not switch between 
antenna jacks on the KX3 itself. The BNC jack is 
always used on the 160-6 m bands, and the SMA 
jack is used only with the KX3-2M/4M module. 
XMIT is equivalent to PTT (push-to-talk). Tapping 
this switch places the KX3 into transmit mode. 
TUNE is used to put out a CW signal at the power 
level selected by the 
 PWR control. This is useful 
with external wattmeters and antenna tuners. If the 
TUN PWR menu entry is set to a numeric value, 
rather than NOR, then this value—if lower— 
overrides the power control setting.

Voice Modes (SSB, AM, FM) 
Basic Voice-Mode Setup 
  To avoid transmitting a signal during voice-
mode setup, you can set  
 PWR  to 0.0 watts. 
§ 
Choose a mode:  Tap MODE to select 
LSB/USB, AM, or FM mode. In SSB modes,  
ALT  alternates between LSB and USB. 
§ 
Hold 
 MON  to set the voice monitor level. 
High MON settings may result in audio 
clipping or distortion. Start with 3 to 5. 
§ 
Tap CMP and set it to 0 using the knob above. 
Tap it again to exit the CMP display. 
§ 
Enable transmit:  Tap XMIT or hold in the 
mic’s PTT switch. Note: Hand mics like the 
Elecraft MH3 should nearly touch your mouth 
when you are speaking (about 1/8” [3 mm]). 
§ 
Adjust mic gain level: While speaking into the 
mic, adjust  
 KEYER/MIC  (mic gain). This 
will turn on the transmit CMP and ALC bar 
graphs. While speaking, adjust mic gain for 
about 5 ALC bars (see below). Mic gain for 
the Elecraft MH3 is typically 15-25. 
 
§ 
Speech compression (optional): To use speech 
compression, tap  CMP  and adjust the level 
using the knob above the switch. While you’re 
speaking, the CMP scale (see above), shows 
compression level. High CMP settings may 
result in distortion. Start with 1 to 10. 
§ 
Set the power level:  Exit transmit mode and 
adjust  
 PWR  to the desired output level.        
Do not use MIC gain to set power level. Set 
mic gain to a fixed level as described above. 
Voice Mode VOX Setup  
VOX selects push-to-talk (PTT) or voice-operated 
(VOX) transmit (VOX icon on). VOX hold time is 
set with  DLY   (pg. 14). 
MENU:VOX GN  (VOX gain) should be set to 
trigger at normal speech level, but not in response 
to incidental noise. Start with low settings (10-20).  
MENU:VOX INH (VOX inhibit, or anti-vox) can 
prevent speaker audio from triggering VOX.  
Transmit Metering in Voice Modes 
In voice modes, you can switch the transmit bar 
graph from  SWR / RF to CMP / ALC  by tapping      
 KEYER/MIC. This also occurs automatically if 
you adjust mic gain or speech compression level. 
FM Operation 
  To disable FM mode, use MENU:FM MODE. 
To setup for repeater use: 
§ 
Hold  ALT  to select simplex, TX up (+), or TX 
down (-). If an offset is in effect, REV swaps 
RX/TX frequencies and offset direction. 
§ 
Set up the repeater offset (MENU:RPT OFS).  
§ 
Select FM VFO step size (MENU:VFO CRS). 
§ 
If PL tone encode is required, hold PITCH to 
turn it on (T icon), and rotate the knob above 
this switch to select the tone frequency. Hold 
PITCH again to turn PL tone encode off. 
Selecting 1750 Hz adds EU 0.5-s tone burst; 
holding PITCH during TX extends the tone. 
§ 
To change the FM deviation level for voice and 
PL tones, see MENU:FM DEV. 
§ 
Squelch:  Tap  
 AF / RF-SQL, then rotate the 
knob to select the desired squelch threshold. (In 
other modes, the alternate knob function is RF 
gain.) Tap the knob again to return to AF gain.  
DTMF (dual-tone, multi-frequency):  To send 
DTMF tones to activate repeater functions:  (1) hold 
PTT; (2) tap FREQ ENT to enable/disable DTMF 
entry; (3) tap 0-9 (use numeric keypad) or special 
characters (use MSG = #, ATU TUNE = *, MODE 
= A, A/B = B, DATA = C, A>B = D); (4) release 
PTT. Note: If transmit is started via the XMIT 
switch rather than PTT, and FREQ ENT is then 
tapped to enter DTMF tones, tap FREQ ENT again 
before exiting transmit via the XMIT switch. 
Otherwise XMIT will still be assigned to keypad 
digit ‘0’, so it can’t be used to end transmit. 
AM Operation 
  To disable AM mode, use MENU:AM MODE. 
AM receive on the KX3 uses envelope detection. 
You can also listen to AM signals in SSB modes. 
In AM transmit, the RF bar graph will indicate 
about 1/3 to 1/2 the power set by the power control. 
Transmit efficiency is lower in AM mode than SSB 
as discussed on pg. 10.

CW Mode 
Basic CW-Mode Setup 
§ 
Mode selection: Tap MODE to select CW 
(CW normal). In some cases an interfering 
received signal can be eliminated by switching 
to CW REV (CW reverse) using ALT. This 
doesn’t affect transmit. 
§ 
Transmitter keying method: The  VOX  
switch selects either VOX or PTT keying for 
CW mode. Most operators use VOX, allowing 
the transmitter to be keyed immediately 
whenever a hand key or keyer paddle is used. 
To manually enable transmit via the XMIT 
switch, select PTT.  
§ 
Set sidetone pitch using PITCH. The ideal 
pitch for most operators falls in the range of 
400-600 Hz. The receiver’s passband will be 
centered at the pitch you select. 
§ 
Set sidetone volume using 
 MON. 
§ 
Adjust the break-in delay:  Tap  DLY  to set 
the break-in or QSK delay (the time before the 
receiver recovers after key-up). A setting of 0 
provides “full break-in” or “full QSK.” (The 
QSK icon will appear.) This allows the receiver 
to recover quickly so you can hear another 
station transmitting between your characters.  
CW Receive Filtering 
As conditions change, you may need to adjust the 
filter passband as described on pg. 12. Also, you’ll 
find the audio peaking filter (APF) to be very useful 
with weak CW signals.  
Off-Air Code Practice 
Sending CW normally produces both a sidetone and 
a transmitted signal. If PTT-CW is selected (by 
holding VOX), hitting the key will generate only a 
sidetone (unless you tap XMIT). This is useful for 
code practice or keyer speed adjustment.  
CW-Mode Menu Settings 
Use the menu to set up iambic keying (CW IAMB), 
keying weight (CW WGHT), and paddle 
normal/reverse or hand key (CW KEY1 for the 
KEY jack, and CW KEY2 for the KXPD3). Also 
use CW WGHT for CW transmit in SSB mode. 
CWT, SPOT and Auto-Spot 
When calling a station, you should try to match 
your frequency to theirs. To facilitate this, the KX3 
provides both manual and automatic spotting for 
CW, FSK-D, and PSK-D signals. See pg. 13. 
CW Text Decode/Display 
The KX3 can decode transmitted and received CW 
signals, displaying the text on VFO B (pg. 19). This 
is especially useful when you’re learning CW, or if 
someone who doesn’t know CW is looking over 
your shoulder while you make CW QSOs. It’s also 
indispensable for CW-to-DATA operation (pg.18).  
CW/DATA Message Record/Play 
There are 6 text message buffers, each holding up to 
250 characters. These apply to CW and to DATA 
modes FSK D and PSK D.  
  Messages can be recorded using the KX3’s 
built-in keyer function (using either your keyer 
paddle or the KXPD3). An external keyer cannot be 
used. Messages can also be created or edited using 
the KX3 Utility computer application. 
Message Record: To start recording, hold REC , 
then select a message buffer by tapping any of 
switches 1 through 6 on the numeric keypad. The 
remaining buffer space will be displayed as you 
send. Tap MSG to terminate record.  
Message Play: To play, tap MSG , then select a 
message buffer (1 through 6). To cancel, tap XMIT  
or hit the keyer paddle or hand key. 
Message Erase: Hold REC , then select a message 
buffer (1 through 6), then hold CLR. 
Auto-Repeat: To auto-repeat a message, tap MSG , 
but then hold rather than tap a message switch (1 
through 6).  MENU:MSG RPT sets the message 
repeat interval (1 to 255 seconds).  
Chaining: Tapping a message switch during 
playback chains another message onto the message 
being played. Holding a message switch during 
playback chains a repeating message.

Advanced Operating Features 
Frequency Memories 
The KX3 has 100 general-purpose frequency 
memories (00-99), plus four quick memories          
on each band, accessed by tapping  1 - 4  on the 
numeric keypad. Each memory stores VFO A and B 
frequencies, modes, and other settings. 
Quick memories provide an easy way to get to 
segments used for each operating mode. For 
example, you could use quick-memory 1 as an SSB 
starting point, use 2 for CW, 3 for data, etc., on 
each band. 
To store a general-purpose memory (00-99): 
First hold  STORE , then locate the desired memory 
by rotating the VFO A knob. The VFO A 
frequencies presently stored in each memory will be 
shown as you scroll through them. When you reach 
the desired memory number, hold STORE again to 
finish, or tap any other switch to cancel. 
To recall a general-purpose memory: Hold     
RCL  (recall), then select memory 00-99 using 
VFO A. Tap any switch to exit.  
To store a per-band quick memory: Hold 
STORE, then tap the target quick memory (1 - 4).   
To recall a per-band quick memory: Hold     
RCL, then tap the target quick memory (1 - 4).   
To erase a general-purpose memory: While 
scrolling through memories to save or recall, hold 
CLR. (Not applicable to quick memories.) 
To add a text label to a general-purpose 
memory: First hold RCL , then select a memory 
(00-99) using VFO A. Next, rotate VFO B to 
select each text label position in turn as indicated by 
the flashing cursor. Use VFO A to change label 
characters (A-Z, 0-9, and various symbols). After 
editing, hold STORE to finish the operation. 
  Adding an asterisk (*) at the start of a label  
designates a memory that is part of a channel-
hopping group (described at right). 
 
  The K3 Memory program (pg. 28) can be used 
to simplify setup and labeling of memories. 
 
Scanning  
Scanning allows the KX3 to tune any portion of a 
band continuously. Normal scanning mutes the 
receiver until a modulated signal is found. “Live” 
scanning keeps the receiver unmuted, and is 
stopped by the operator. This is useful on very quiet 
bands. 
To use scanning: 
§ 
Set VFO A and VFO B to the desired start/end 
frequencies. Also select an operating mode.  
§ 
Select a tuning rate for the scan using RATE 
(10 Hz or 100 Hz), or KHZ (for fast scanning). 
§ 
Store this setup in any frequency memory. 
§ 
To start scanning: 
§ 
Recall a scanning memory using RCL.  
§ 
Hold SCAN to start scanning. To scan with the 
receiver live (unmuted), continue to hold 
SCAN until you see AF ON (about 2 seconds).  
To stop scanning:  Rotate VFO A or tap any 
switch. To restart, hold SCAN. 
Channel Hopping 
Scanning (or manually tuning) among a group of 
memories is referred to as channel hopping. This is 
most useful on channelized bands (e.g., 60, 6, and 2 
meters). The memories in the group must all be in 
the same band, but can have different modes. 
To set up channel hopping: 
§ 
Set up VFO A for the first target frequency and 
mode. Store this setup in a general-purpose 
memory (00-99) as described at left.  
§ 
Set up and store the remaining frequencies in 
the next successive numbered memories. 
§ 
Add a text label to each memory in the group, 
using an asterisk (*) as the first character. 
To start manual channel hopping,  RCL  any one of 
the memories in the target group. VFO A will now 
hop among the grouped memories as you turn it.  
You can then start scan (or live scan) among the 
grouped memories using SCAN. To disable channel 
hopping, tap RATE or change bands.

Data Modes 
The KX3 supports data operation via a computer 
and special software. But it can also be used in 
RTTY and PSK31 modes without a computer via 
the KX3’s built-in FSK D and PSK D modes.  
  5.0 watts or lower is recommended in all 
data modes. The KX3 will reduce power, if 
necessary, to maintain a safe operating temperature. 
FSK D Mode (RTTY) 
  MIC gain, RX/TX EQ, and CMP are not 
applicable to FSK D and PSK D modes. 
FSK D (RTTY1) is the easiest data mode to use: 
§ 
Tap DATA to select data mode. 
§ 
Tap DATA again and rotate 
 OFS/VFO B to 
select the FSK D sub-mode. Tap the switch 
again to exit the sub-mode display. A dual-
passband (mark/space) filter will appear: 
                       
 
§ 
Hold TEXT to turn on text decode. 
§ 
Hold CWT to turn on the tuning aid (pg. 13). 
You’ll now be able to copy RTTY signals. RTTY 
can often be found on 20 meters from 14080-14090 
kHz. (If you see only numbers and punctuation, try 
tapping DATA twice to restore “letters” mode.) 
To transmit in FSK D mode (CW-to-Data): Plug 
a keyer paddle into the KEY jack, or attach a 
KXPD3 paddle. (See the CW KEY1 and CW 
KEY2 menu entries.) When you send CW, the KX3 
will convert it to RTTY. (You’ll hear the CW 
sidetone as well as weak RTTY tones.) You can use 
CW message memories in FSK D mode, as well as 
KX3 Utility’s Terminal function (pg. 28). 
 You cannot use a hand key for this function. 
 The KX3 adds a 4-second “idle time” (giving 
you time to decide what to say next) after you stop 
sending. To terminate the idle period quickly, send 
the character  . . - -  in CW. This “IM” prosign can 
also be inserted at the end of message buffers. 
                                                      
1 FSK stands for frequency-shift keying, used with RTTY 
(radioteletype). The KX3 uses a 170 Hz shift. RTTY 
signals are encoded using a 5-level code called baudot, at 
a baud rate of 45 baud, or about 60 words per minute. 
PSK D Mode (PSK31) 
PSK D is the KX3’s built-in implementation of 
PSK312, a narrow-band data mode which is reliable 
even at very low power levels. 5 watts or less is 
strongly recommended to keep distortion low. 
To use PSK D, set up the KX3 as described at left 
for FSK D, but select the PSK D sub-mode. Before 
attempting to transmit in this mode, you should 
practice tuning in signals. Try 14070-14073 kHz. 
CWT can be used in this mode (see pg. 13). 
DATA A and AFSK A (Audio Data Modes) 
Many audio-generated data transmissions can be 
heard on the bands, using PSK31, RTTY, Pactor, 
Olivia, MFSK, JT65 and other modes. A computer, 
sound card, and appropriate software are normally 
used. DATA A mode is provided for this purpose. 
Unlike SSB modes, DATA A disables compression 
and RX/TX EQ. Upper sideband is the default. 
For audio-based RTTY, you can also use AFSK A. 
Like FSK D, AFSK A provides a dual-passband 
RTTY filter and text decode. The VFO is tuned to 
the mark frequency. Lower sideband is the default. 
To use these audio data modes: 
§ 
Tap DATA twice; rotate 
 OFS/VFO B to 
select the DATA A or AFSK A. Tap the 
switch again to exit the sub-mode display. 
§ 
In AFSK A mode, optionally hold TEXT to 
turn on text decode, and CWT to turn on the 
CW/data tuning aid. 
§ 
Connect your computer’s audio output to the 
MIC jack. (You can either wire the plug to 
activate the PTT line on transmit, or use VOX.) 
Connect the KX3’s PHONES jack to your 
computer’s audio input. High-quality shielded 
cables should be used. You may need an 
attenuator if the drive levels are too high. 
§ 
Refer to your data communications software 
manual to determine how to set up the KX3’s 
VFO for accurate frequency display.  
§ 
While transmitting audio data, adjust MIC gain 
for no more than 4 to 5 bars of ALC indication. 
§ 
RX/TX EQ and CMP are not applicable. 
                                                      
2 PSK stands for phase-shift keying. 31 refers to the baud 
rate, 31.25 baud. PSK31 signals are encoded using a very 
efficient representation called varicode.

Text Decode And Display 
The KX3 can decode CW, PSK31 (PSK D) and 
RTTY (FSK D). CW speeds from about 8 to 70 
WPM can be decoded. Decoded text is displayed on 
VFO B. If no signal is tuned in, random characters 
may be displayed. 
To set up text decode: 
§ 
Select the desired mode (CW, FSK D, or      
PSK D) using MODE or DATA.  
§ 
If a special VFO B display mode is in effect, 
cancel it by tapping DISP. 
§ 
You’ll probably want to turn on CWT as a 
tuning aid (pg. 13). This also enables auto-spot, 
which can automatically tune-in signals. 
§ 
Hold TEXT .  In DATA modes, this will 
alternate between DEC ON and DEC OFF. 
(The T mode icon appears when it is on). In 
CW mode, use  
 OFS/VFO B  to select a text 
decode mode. TX ONLY displays only CW 
characters you send using the internal keyer. To 
decode text from on-air CW signals, use one of 
the RX THRn  settings. Turn CWT on and 
adjust the threshold so that the CWT bar graph 
segment flashes in time with the incoming CW. 
Use higher RX THRn settings for stronger 
signals as well as faster CW speeds. 
§ 
Use a filter bandwidth of 0.30 kHz or less. 
§ 
For further details on data modes, see pg. 18. 
Programmable Function Switches 
Two often-used menu entries can be assigned to  
programmable function switches PF1 and PF2.  
To set up a programmable function switch: 
§ 
Hold MENU and rotate VFO B to find the target 
menu entry.  
§ 
Hold PF1 or PF2 to assign it to this menu 
entry. You’ll see PF1 SET or PF2 SET. 
§ 
Exit the menu.  
If a parameter has only two values, accessing it with 
a PF1 or PF2 will change the value and exit menu.  
Macros can also be assigned to PF1 and PF2. 
Macros are sequences of control commands that 
perform operations such as entering SPLIT mode 
and moving VFO B up. Refer to the K3 and KX3 
Programmer’s Reference or KX3utility. 
Split and XIT  
Sometimes you’ll hear a DX station being called by 
many other stations. To ensure that he has a clear 
transmit channel, the DX station may say “UP” or 
“DOWN” to indicate that he’s listening above or 
below his transmit frequency. For example, in CW 
mode he may transmit on 7025 kHz, but listen in 
the vicinity of 7027 kHz. In this case he would 
periodically say “UP 2” (or just “UP”) as a 
reminder of where to call him. SSB split operation 
is similar but may occur over a much wider range. 
To use split, first tap A 
 B twice to set VFO B to 
the same mode, frequency, and filter settings as 
VFO A. Then tune VFO B up about 2 kHz. Finally, 
hold SPLIT (the SPLIT icon will turn on). The TX 
icon’s arrow will now point at VFO B, since VFO 
B is now controlling your transmit frequency. 
Before you transmit using split, you may need to 
fine-tune your VFO B frequency. Setting it 2 kHz 
above VFO A is a good start, but many other 
stations may be trying to call at exactly this same 
location. The DX operator will be aware of this and 
will tune up and down from this nominal frequency 
when searching for callers. He’ll probably tune up 
in small steps as he “picks off” each station.  
This is where the REV switch comes in: it reverses 
the A and B VFOs so that you’re temporarily 
receiving on your transmit frequency. During this 
time, tune VFO A around a bit to see if you can 
identify who is presently working the DX station, 
then position yourself just above this frequency.  
REV remains in effect as long as you hold it down. 
As soon as you’ve released it, the VFOs will be 
swapped back, and you’ll once again be listening to 
the DX station. With any luck your next 
transmission will occur right where he’s listening. 
Dual watch with split: With dual watch enabled, 
you don’t need to use REV, since you can listen to 
both your receive and transmit frequencies (pg. 20). 
XIT as an alternative to split:  If you’re trying to 
preserve VFO B as a holding register tuned 
someplace else in the band, you may want to use 
XIT rather than split in the above situation. In this 
example, you’d turn on XIT and rotate the offset 
control to about +2.00 kHz. You’ll then be 
transmitting 2 kHz above VFO A. To do the 
equivalent of REV, you can briefly turn RIT on as 
well. Turn off RIT to listen to the DX station.

Audio Effects 
If you have stereo headphones or stereo external 
speakers, you can take advantage of the KX3’s DSP 
audio effects (AFX). These create an illusion of 
greater acoustic “space,” resulting in a less-
fatiguing receiver sound and in some cases better 
copy of weak signals. 
MENU:AFX MD is used to select the desired AFX 
setting. Available selections include OFF, DELAY 
(simulated stereo), and PITCH (which “maps” 
signals from left to right according to pitch). 
Dual Watch 
Dual watch allows you to listen to both VFO A and 
VFO B frequencies at the same time, as if you had 
two receivers.  
  The use of stereo headphones or external 
speakers is required with dual watch. You’ll hear 
VFO A’s signal in the left ear, and VFO B’s in the 
right.  
Dual watch has various uses. For example, you 
might be waiting for one station at VFO B’s 
frequency to complete a QSO, while using VFO A 
to look for other stations. You can tap A / B to 
alternate between the two. Dual watch is also ideal 
for working DX stations who are listening at some 
offset from their transmit frequency. You can listen 
to the DX station on VFO B, then use VFO A to 
listen for a clear spot in which to transmit. 
To turn on dual watch: Set MENU:DUAL RX to 
AUTO. This turns on the SUB (“sub receiver”) 
icon. If you turn dual watch on/off frequently, you 
may wish to assign it to PF1 or PF2 (see pg. 19). 
Dual Watch Limitations:   
§ 
The distance between VFOs is limited to 15 
kHz. If you exceed this with DUAL RX set to 
AUTO, the SUB flashes slowly as a reminder. 
§ 
A wider roofing filter than normal will be 
selected automatically, if required, based on the 
frequency span between VFO A and B. 
§ 
Dual watch overrides the normal audio effects 
mode (AFX MD).  
§ 
Headphones or external speakers must be used. 
Receive Audio Equalization (RX EQ) 
The KX3 provides 8 bands of receive audio 
equalization via the RX EQ menu entry. RX EQ 
can compensate for physical acoustics (of the room, 
headphones, internal speaker, external speaker), 
tailoring the audio to your personal preference.  
Two receive EQ setups are provided: one for CW 
mode, and the other for all voice modes. RX EQ 
does not apply to DATA modes.  
In the RX EQ menu entry, the VFO A display 
shows 8 individual vertical bar graphs. The example 
below shows various amounts of EQ for each band.  
 
 
The center frequencies of the 8 audio EQ bands are 
50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 2400, and 3200 Hz. 
To select a band to change, tap 1-8 on the keypad. 
For example, tapping 1 selects the 50-Hz band.  
Next, rotate VFO A to specify boost or cut (+/- 16 
dB). The illustration above shows the 800 Hz EQ 
band (0.80 kHz) being set to +1 dB of boost. 
You can hold  CLR to reset all of the RX EQ bands 
to 0 dB (no cut or boost). 
Transmit Audio Equalization (TX EQ) 
  Most microphones, including the Elecraft 
MH3, will provide good audio quality with little 
or no TX EQ. High settings can cause distortion. 
If required, transmit audio equalization can 
compensate for microphone and voice variations. 
MENU:TX EQ  works exactly the same as RX EQ, 
and can be used during transmit. Two transmit EQ 
setups are provided: one for SSB, the other for 
wideband voice modes (ESSB, AM, FM). TX EQ is 
not applicable to CW or DATA modes. 
While adjusting TX EQ, monitor your voice using 
headphones (use 
 MON to set the level), or listen 
to your transmitted signal on another receiver. If 
you hear distortion, reduce all TX EQ bands. You 
may also have excessive mic gain or compression.

SSB/CW VFO Offset 
The KX3 can automatically offset the VFO 
frequency when you switch from SSB to CW mode, 
so other stations will hear the correct CW pitch. See 
MENU:CW WGHT for details. 
Digital Voice Recorder (DVR) 
You can record two voice messages of up to 15 
seconds each, such as your call sign or a CQ, and 
play them back one time or with auto-repeat.  
  Use the transmit voice monitor to hear DVR 
playback. Hold  
 MON , then set the level while 
speaking into the mic. 5 is a good starting point. 
DVR Record: Hold REC , then tap 1 or 2 on the 
numeric keypad. The current message will be 
erased (4 seconds). When prompted, tap XMIT and 
start speaking into the mic immediately (no need to 
push PTT). Tap XMIT again to terminate record. 
MIC gain cannot be adjusted during DVR message 
play. The gain setting at time of recording is used.  
DVR Play: Tap MSG , then tap 1 or 2. To cancel, 
tap XMIT  or hit the keyer paddle or hand key. To 
auto-repeat a message, tap MSG , but then hold 
rather than tap  1 or  2.  MENU:MSG RPT sets 
the repeat interval (1 to 255 seconds).  
Transmit Noise Gate 
The noise gate function mutes mic audio below a 
selected audio threshold. This is useful in vehicles 
and when operating in noisy outdoor environments. 
See MENU:TX GATE for details. 
Transmit Inhibit and External PTT 
The GPIO pin of the ACC2 connector can be 
configured as a transmit inhibit or PTT input by 
setting  MENU:ACC2 IO  to the desired setting. 
Cross-Mode Operation; CW-in-SSB 
Cross-mode operation is possible in some cases. For 
example, you could set up VFO A for SSB receive, 
and VFO B for CW transmit, then enter SPLIT.  
  You can also send CW when SSB mode is 
selected for VFO A just by hitting the key. The SSB 
station will hear the signal at your sidetone pitch. 
See MENU:CW WGHT for details (pg. 35). 
Transverter Bands 
Nine user-definable bands are provided for use with 
transverters. These can be used with the Elecraft 
KX3-2M/4M internal 2-m/4-m module, Elecraft 
XV-Series, or other transverters.  
  The KX3 does not have a low-level 
transverter output; transverters are driven from 
the main antenna jack. This requires the use of 
transverters that have a common receive/transmit 
antenna jack and associated T/R switching. Consult 
the transverter manual for drive power limitations 
and switching requirements. 
The ACC2 jack provides a keyline output for 
keying transverters. The ACC2 jack also provides a 
GPIO pin that can be used to select among multiple 
transverters based on the band selected at the KX3. 
This is further explained below. 
Transverter Band Setup 
Transverter bands are set up using the XV menu 
entries, as follows: 
 
§ 
If a KX3-2M/4M module is installed, set 
MENU:2M/4M to NOR or SLEEP nn. 
§ 
Locate the XVn ON menu entry. Tap 1 – 9 to 
specify which transverter band to configure. Set 
the parameter to YES to enable band n.  
§ 
XVn RF sets the operating frequency (MHz). 
§ 
XVn IF specifies the I.F. band. Use 50 MHz 
for the KX3-2M option, 21 for the KX3-4M. 
§ 
XVn PWR sets maximum power output in 
watts for each transverter band. Maximum is 
3.0 watts for the KX3-2M/4M option. 
§ 
XVn OFS can compensate for frequency offset 
in the transverter’s oscillator. (An offset is not 
required for the KX3-2M/4M, since its 
oscillator signal is derived from the KX3’s 
main synthesizer. If there is a frequency error, 
calibrate synthesizer using REF CAL.)  
§ 
XVn ADR should be set to INT TRN 0 for use 
with the KX3-2M/4M module. XVn ADR can 
also be used to specify an optional Elecraft XV-
series transverter selection address; addresses 
TRN1-TRN7 are recognized for this purpose. 
To select XV-series transverters using this 
method, set MENU:ACC2 IO to TRN CTRL, 
and connect the ACC2 jack’s GPIO pin to the 
transverter’s auxBus line.

Special VFO B Displays 
The KX3 can continuously display time of day or 
one of several operational parameters on the VFO B 
display. To access these displays, tap  DISP , then 
rotate the  
 OFS/VFO B  control. 
The available special displays are listed below. 
§ 
24-hour time obtained from the real-time-clock 
on the KXBC3 option module. If a KXBC3 is 
not installed, the time since last power-on will 
be displayed. Set the time using MENU:TIME. 
You can also set an alarm time anytime in the 
next 24 hours using MENU:ALARM. This may 
be useful as a reminder of a contest or operating 
schedule. The alarm will turn the KX3 on if it 
occurs when power is off.  
§ 
Power supply voltage. This and the next four 
parameters stay visible even in transmit mode, 
so you can check key-down conditions.  
§ 
Internal battery voltage.  An asterisk (*) is 
added to this display during battery charging. 
See BAT CHG menu entry.  
§ 
Supply current. Typical receive-mode current 
is 0.15-0.25 amps (150-250 mA). It will be 
higher with the backlight, preamp, or isolation 
amp on, or when using the KX3-2M/4M. 
Transmit current is typically 1 to 3 A, varying 
with band, supply voltage, and load SWR. 
§ 
Power amplifier (PA) temperature. The 
KX3’s internal PA temperature is shown as 
PA.I nnC  (I = Internal). If a 2-/4-m module 
(KX3-2M/4M) is in use, its PA temperature is 
shown, as PA.x nnC (where x=2 or 4).  If a 
KXPA100 is connected via the remote-control 
cable, PA MODE is ON, and PWR is 10 W or 
higher, the KXPA100’s PA temperature is 
shown, as PA.X nnC (X = eXternal). PA 
temperature will rise gradually as you transmit.  
§ 
Synthesizer (OSC) temperature. A few 
degrees of OSC temperature rise is normal 
during transmit. Also see MENU:REF CAL. 
§ 
Audio Signal level (AFV). Shows the KX3’s 
audio output level, prior to the AF gain control 
(the AF gain control has no effect on this 
reading). The reading will vary with preamp 
and attenuator settings as well as the RF gain 
control. AFV is normally used in conjunction 
with the dBV function (at right). 
§ 
Relative audio signal (dBV). This display can 
be used to measure receiver sensitivity or 
gain/loss of various stages, or compare two 
signals. To use it, first select AFV (described at 
left) and allow the voltage reading to stabilize. 
(This may not be possible with modulated or 
rapidly changing signals.) Once the signal 
appears stable, select dBV. You should now see 
a reading of around 0 dBV (see Glossary) 
relative to the last AFV reading. If you change 
the setting of the preamp or attenuator, you 
should see this reading change. However, it 
may not change as much as you expect unless 
you turn AGC off using the AGC menu entry. 
(Be sure to turn AF gain down before 
turning AGC off, as the signal may become 
very loud.) Measurement of receive sensitivity 
(MDS) requires a calibrated 1-µV signal source 
such as an Elecraft XG3. These sources include 
instructions for measuring MDS. 
Extended Single Sideband (ESSB) 
An increase in SSB voice bandwidth may improve 
fidelity and reduce listening fatigue. However, this 
also increases signal bandwidth, and is not 
appropriate for use when bands are crowded. 
ESSB receive 
The KX3’s normal SSB receive bandwidth is about 
2.8 kHz. This can be widened by using the PBT  
control. In voice modes, by default function I is 
low-cut and function II is high cut. Tap the control 
to select function I or II, and rotate it to adjust the 
passband. (Also see PBT SSB.) 
ESSB transmit is set up as follows: 
§ 
Locate the TX ESSB menu entry. Tap 1 to turn 
ESSB on, then use VFO A to select the desired 
transmit bandwidth. The + icon will turn on in 
the mode area of the LCD. 
§ 
ESSB, AM, and FM have separate TX EQ from 
regular SSB, allowing you to optimize the 
transmit passband for these wider-bandwidth 
modes. See the TX EQ menu entry for details. 
§ 
You may wish to assign the TX ESSB menu 
entry to a programmable function switch if 
you’ll be turning it on/off frequently.

Internal Batteries  
 
The KX3’s internal battery pack can be used with eight 1.2-1.6 volt AA cells of any type. The pack typically 
provides 4-6 hours of casual operation, ideal for field use or as backup during power outages. An internal NiMH 
charger is also available (KXBC3, pg. 24). 
Opening the Enclosure 
To open the enclosure for battery installation, unplug the KXPD3 paddle, then follow the steps below.  
   1    Loosen all four thumb screws. Then slowly pull the halves apart only about 1/4” (6 mm). 
            
               
 
   2    Fold open starting at the back.           3    Continue opening. Do not disconnect the flex cable. 
 
  When closing the enclosure, be sure not to pinch the battery wires (red and black). If the flex cable 
becomes loose at either end, press the connectors back into their sockets. 
 
Recommended Battery Types 
Lithium non-rechargeable batteries (e.g., Energizer 
L91) are expensive, but their flat discharge curve 
and 3 amp-hour rating provides maximum operating 
time. In receive, the pack voltage will be about 12 
V. In transmit, it will drop to 9-10 V due to the 
cells’ high internal series resistance. This voltage is 
sufficient for operation at up to 5.0 watts. 
NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) batteries have a flat 
discharge curve, like lithium cells, but a lower pack 
voltage (typically 10 V receive, 8.5-9 V transmit). 
Power output of up to 5.0 W is possible, though 3.0 
W is recommended to extend battery life. The 
advantage of NiMH cells is that they can be 
recharged hundreds of times, either externally (in as 
little as 1 to 2 hours), or internally (typically 8-12 
hours, using the KXBC3 option module). 
 
 
 
Alkaline batteries can be used if there’s no other 
alternative, but they have several disadvantages. 
They should always be used with power output set 
to 3.0 W or less to minimize transmit current drain. 
They have a steep discharge curve, so the pack will 
drop from 12 V to 8 V in about half the time of 
Lithium or NiMH cells.  
  Alkaline batteries are prone to leakage, and 
must be removed after use. Damage caused by 
battery leakage is not covered by the warranty. 

============================================================

To maximize Battery Life: 
§ 
Set power to 3.0 W or less when possible. 
This uses a high-efficiency transmit mode. 
§ 
Turn off the backlight (BKLIGHT) and the 
isolation amp (RX ISO) when not needed. 
§ 
Use headphones. 
§ 
Use SLEEP in FM mode (2M/4M). 
§ 
Use the auto-off timer (AUTO OFF). 
§ 
Use BAT MIN to set up an appropriate         
BAT LOW warning level for your battery type. 
Note: Regardless of the BAT LOW warning 
level, the KX3 will turn itself off if the power 
supply or battery goes below 7.5 volts.  
KXBC3 Internal NiMH Charger 
  Charge only NiMH cells with the KXBC3. 
The KXBC3 module provides a convenient way to 
keep internal NiMH batteries charged. You can 
operate while batteries are charging.  
To ensure safe charging of all NiMH cell types, the 
KXBC3 uses a “C/10” charge rate (about 200-250 
mA, or 1/10th of typical cell capacity in mA-hours).   
A 13.8 volt minimum, 500 mA or higher power 
supply is required to complete a full charge.   
To enable the KXBC3 after installation: Set the 
BAT CHG menu entry from NOT INST to CHG 
OFF. Exit the menu. Turn power off and back on. 
To start charging: Set BAT CHG to the desired 
charge time. If batteries are fully depleted, use 8-16 
hours. Exit the menu.  
To cancel charging: Set BAT CHG to OFF. If the 
KX3 is turned off during charging, it “hibernates,” 
showing remaining battery charge time on the 
display. The KX3 will turn itself off when charging 
is complete. 
Real-Time Clock 
The KXBC3’s real-time clock (RTC), powered by 
the battery pack, shows 24-hour time. Use the 
TIME menu entry to set the clock, tapping 1/2/3 to 
select HH/MM/SS. Use ALARM to set the alarm 
time. To see time displayed on VFO B, tap DISP. 
  Preserving clock registers during battery 
swap: The current time will be preserved during a 
battery swap if you connect an external supply or if 
you complete the swap within about two minutes. If 
the time is lost, use MENU:TIME to reset it. 
 
VFO Friction Adjustment 
The spin rate of the VFO A knob can be adjusted by 
moving the knob in or out slightly. The rubber 
finger grip on the VFO A knob covers the knob’s 
set screw, so it must be removed first.  
  In the following procedure, use only your 
fingernails; a tool may scratch the knob. 
Using your fingernails at the point identified below, 
pull the finger grip forward slightly. Rotate the 
knob and repeat until the grip can be pulled off. 
 
 
 
 
Use the supplied 5/64" (2 mm) Allen wrench to 
loosen the set screw.  
Between the knob and front panel is a felt washer 
which, when compressed, reduces the spin rate. 
Move the knob in or out in small increments until 
the desired rate is obtained. (Re-tighten the set 
screw each time so you can spin the knob.) Then 
and replace the finger grip.

Options and Accessories 
This section describes all available KX3 options 
and accessories. Option modules are easily user-
installable, in any order, without soldering.  
MH3 Hand mic: The MH3 was designed 
specifically for the KX3. It includes a high-quality 
mic element, rugged right-angle plug, PTT switch, 
and VFO UP/DN function buttons.  
KXPD3 Keyer paddle: The KXPD3 is an 
adjustable precision paddle that attaches directly to 
the front of the KX3. It can be easily removed for 
storage or transport. The paddles are designed for 
both left- and right-handed use, and can be 
electrically reversed or used as a hand-key. 
KXBC3 Internal NiMH battery charger and 
real-time clock: If you install NiMH cells in the 
KX3’s internal battery pack, you can charge them 
using the KXBC3 module (see Internal Batteries, 
pg. 23). The KXBC3 also includes a real-time clock 
with an alarm function. The time can be displayed 
in the KX3’s VFO B area by tapping  DISP. The 
alarm can be used to turn the KX3 on at a specified 
time, or to remind the operator of an on-air event. 
KXFL3 Dual-bandwidth roofing filter module: 
A roofing filter is a narrow-band analog filter that 
better rejects strong signals that could cause 
receiver blocking (desense) or intermodulation 
distortion. When the KXFL3 is installed, the KX3 
automatically selects the appropriate roofing filter 
as the bandwidth is adjusted (pg. 12).  
KXAT3 Wide-range internal automatic antenna 
tuner (ATU): With a KXAT3 installed, you can 
use single-band or random-length antennas on 
multiple bands. Using an ATU can improve 
transmit power transfer as well as receive 
sensitivity. (See pg. 6 for antenna suggestions.) 
KX3-2M (2-m) or KX3-4M (4-m) module: 
Provides all-mode, low-power operation on 2 or 4  
meters. Great for emergency field communciations, 
coordination, etc. 
KXPA100 100-W amplifier: The KXPA100 is a 
rugged 100-W, 160-6 m amp that can be used with 
any QRP transceiver. An optional internal 100-W 
ATU is available for the amp (KXAT100). 
PX3 Panadapter:  A full-color, fast, precision 
spectrum display fully integrated with the KX3. 
Firmware Upgrades 
New features and improvements are available to all 
KX3 owners via firmware upgrades. Upgrades may 
also be required when you install option modules.  
Please visit the Elecraft KX3 software page 
(www.elecraft.com/KX3/KX3_software.htm) to 
obtain our free firmware download application, 
KX3 Utility. This program runs on PCs, Macs, and 
Linux platforms. In addition to firmware 
downloading, KX3 Utility provides automated TX 
gain calibration, a custom sign-on banner, 
configuration save/restore, CW/DATA message 
editing, and a CW/DATA terminal function. 
  Some applications or peripheral devices may 
interfere with KX3 downloads; check the Help 
information in KX3 Utility if you have difficulty. 
Checking your Firmware Revision 
Use the FW REVS menu entry to determine your 
firmware revision. The serial number of your 
transceiver, if needed, can be obtained using the 
SER NUM menu entry. 
KX3 Firmware Self-Test 
If the KX3 detects an error in its firmware (an 
incorrect checksum of all bytes in the program), it 
will flash the TX LED and show MCU LD on the 
LCD. 
If this occurs, connect the KX3 to your computer, 
then run KX3 Utility, which will reload the 
firmware. While firmware is loading, the Delta-F 
LED (∆f) will flash. When the download is 
complete, the KX3 should reset and run normally.   
Forcing a Firmware Download 
If you accidentally load an old or incompatible 
firmware version and find the KX3 unresponsive, 
do the following: (1) Unplug the KX3 from the 
power supply. If internal batteries are installed, also 
remove one battery. (2) Plug a power supply in (or 
reinstall the removed battery). (3) hold the KX3’s 
BAND- and  ATU TUNE  together for about 10 
seconds, after which you’ll see the TX LED flash 
(you’ll also see MCU LD on the LCD). (4) 
Connect the KX3 to a computer and run KX3 
Utility, which will load new firmware.

SDR Applications 
The KX3 provides a special receiver output jack,          
RX I/Q, for use with the Elecraft PX3 Panadapter. 
The RX I/Q output can also be used for software-
defined radio (SDR) applications3 running on a 
computer or other device. 
The primary benefit of such applications is that, like 
the PX3, they can provide a real-time display of a 
band of frequencies above and below the signal to 
which the KX3 is tuned. You can use this display to 
quickly find signals of interest, examine modulation 
and noise characteristics, etc. (This capability can 
also be found in dedicated instruments called 
panadapters or spectrum analyzers.) 
Since the KX3’s RX I/Q signal is analog, it must be 
converted to a digital signal by means of a two-
channel (stereo) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). 
Most PCs have this in the form of a built-in stereo 
sound-card.  It is important that the input to the 
PC be in stereo.  Most “mic” inputs are mono, and 
cannot be used.  Most “line inputs” are stereo, and 
can be used.  
If your PC lacks a suitable input, there are third-
party soundcards available for USB, PCI, PCIe, 
Firewire and other expansion buses. 
There are many SDR applications available as 
freeware on various platforms (PC, Mac, iPad, etc.). 
The quality of the spectrum display they provide 
depends heavily on the quality of the soundcard’s 
ADC inputs.  An excellent reference on potentially 
suitable sound cards may be found on the web by 
searching for “LP-PAN sound card tests”. 
A cable with a 2.5 mm (3/32”) plug on one end and 
a plug that matches your sound card input on the 
other end (typically 3.5 mm [1/8”] stereo) is 
required. 
Once you have a cable and soundcard, you’ll need 
to download suitable software and load it on your 
PC. Follow the directions supplied by the program, 
usually in the form of a help file. There may be user 
                                                      
3 The RX I/Q jack’s analog signal is in I and Q format. I 
and Q refer to the two parts of a phase-quadrature signal, 
which simply means the two signals are 90 degrees apart 
in phase. The PX3, as well as PC software applications, 
can use this information to mathematically reconstruct 
the signals for display and demodulation purposes. 
groups for your program that can help if you have 
difficulty understanding its installation or operation. 
A PC program suitable for most purposes is 
“HDSDR”.  It is available as of this writing at 
        http://www.hdsdr.de 
 
Follow the directions provided by the HDSDR 
program for setup and operation. Another popular 
SDR program is “NaP3”. 
Tips for setting up SDR Programs with the KX3: 
§ 
When you first run the SDR program, the 
frequency displayed may be incorrect, but the 
spectrum display will still be accurate in terms 
of offsets.  Setting the center frequency display 
to 1.000 or 10.000 MHz, for example, will 
make it easy to see how many kHz above or 
below the current KX3 frequency another 
signal is. 
§ 
Initially connect only the IQ signal cable 
between the KX3 and the PC soundcard. Leave 
the USB/serial cable for radio control 
disconnected until you have the spectrum 
display working properly. 
§ 
Select the correct soundcard input for the 
program.  If your PC has an internal soundcard 
but you are using an add-on card, you must 
configure the program to use the correct 
soundcard. 
§ 
Set the correct sampling rate.  Use of 48 kHz 
sampling will result in a display of almost 48 
kHz: 24 kHz above and 24 kHz below the 
frequency to which the KX3 is tuned.  96 kHz 
sampling will yield approximately +/- 48 kHz 
of spectrum, and 192 kHz sampling will yield a 
display of about +/- 96 kHz. 
§ 
Enable the RX IQ output from the KX3 by 
setting MENU: RX I/Q to ON. (This increases 
the KX3’s receive-mode current drain by about 
10-15 mA.) 
§ 
The RX I/Q outputs from a receiver are not 
“flat” over an infinite frequency range; the 
signal-conversion process results in some slope 
(decrease in gain) as you move farther from the 
center frequency. In the case of the KX3, the 
signal will be reduced by about 2.5 dB at +/- 24 
kHz, 4 dB at +/- 48 kHz, and 7 dB at +/- 96 
kHz.  The spectrum amplitude on the display, 

============================================================
PAGE 27
============================================================

 
 
 
27 
 
 
including the apparent noise floor of the 
receiver, will “roll off” by these amounts. 
§ 
If you have an accurate signal level source 
(such as an Elecraft XG-series signal source or 
a signal generator), you can calibrate the signal 
amplitude following directions provided by the 
SDR program. 
§ 
After you are comfortable with setting up and 
using the spectrum display, you can connect the 
USB/serial cable between the PC and the KX3.  
§ 
Typically, some spectral noise will appear in 
the display in the form of “spikes” or 
modulation sidebands. These can arise from 
several sources, including nearby power 
supplies, ground noise, or the computer and its 
peripherals. You can often use isolation 
transformers, improve grounding, and shielded 
cables to reduce the amplitude of these signals. 
Note: Try setting up without isolation 
transformers, initially. They can sometimes 
add signal pickup that makes the spectrum 
display much noisier. 
§ 
Some low-level spikes may appear in the 
spectral display that originate at the KX3. 
These are usually low enough in amplitude to 
be masked by band noise when a suitable 
antenna is connected. 
§ 
The HDSDR program can also display the 
actual frequency range in use if it is set up to 
communicate with the KX3. To do this, set up 
the program to use KX3, K3, or Kenwood 
protocol using the procedure and support files 
described on the HDSDR website. Connect the 
KX3’s ACC1 jack to a USB or RS232 port on 
the computer (see pg. 5). After configuration, 
the program should then correctly display the 
actual signal frequencies as you tune the KX3.  
You may also be able to tune the KX3 from the 
program, depending on the program’s features.

Remote Control of the KX3 
Computer Control and Logging 
With appropriate software, any computer with an 
RS232 or USB port can be used to control the KX3. 
Required connections are covered on pg. 5. 
Third-party logging and contesting software is 
available for various computers and operating 
systems. Select KX3 as the target radio when 
available. If not, select K3 or K2.  
For a list of compatible software applications, 
including configuration requirements, please visit  
      http://www.elecraft.com/k2_remote.htm 
Using the KX3 as a Remote Front Panel 
You can use the KX3 as a front panel for a remotely 
located KX3 or K3. (At present this feature is 
experimental, providing limited control 
capabilities.) The two transceivers can be tied 
together via the internet or wiFi using adapters at 
each end that handle data and audio. An alternative 
is to tie the transceivers together directly via the 
serial port (ACC1), using a “null-modem” cable (a 
cable with the tip and ring connections swapped 
from one end to the other).  
To enable the remote-control function at the “local” 
KX3, which acts as a front panel only, set 
MENU:AUTO INF (auto-info) to RIG CTRL. 
Remote-Control Commands 
The KX3 has a rich set of remote-control 
commands. These commands use ordinary ASCII 
characters, so they can be easily tested using a 
terminal emulator or the Command Tester screen in 
KX3 Utility. For example, the command “FA;” 
returns the current VFO A frequency. Using the 
same command, you can set the frequency, e.g. 
“FA00007040000;” sets the VFO to 7.040 MHz. 
Many specialized commands are provided in 
addition to the core set of commands supported by 
the K3 and K2. Please refer to the K3/KX3 
Programmer’s Reference for further details. 
Remote Power On/Off 
To turn the KX3 on, a remote-control system can 
place 8 to 12 volts DC on the mic jack’s PTT line 
for 100 ms or longer. (The ACC2 jack’s PTT IN pin 
function cannot be used for power-on control. Use 
only the MIC PTT line.)   
To turn the KX3 off, the controller must send the 
KX3 a “PS0;” command via the ACC1 jack (RS232 
or USB, depending on the cable used). If the 
controller also turns off the KX3’s power supply, it 
should first allow 100 ms for the KX3 to shut down. 
Automatic Antenna Control 
Some antenna control units (e.g., those used with 
SteppIR™ antennas) can track the KX3’s band and  
frequency by watching for “IF;” (rig information) 
packets from the transceiver. Some computer 
logging/contesting applications set up the KX3 to 
output these messages periodically, allowing the 
antenna control unit to “eavesdrop.”  
If you’re not using such software, or if you’re not 
using a computer at all, you can still set up the KX3 
to output “IF;” packets periodically to an antenna 
controller. To do this, set MENU:AUTOINF to 
ANT CTRL. The packets are sent once per second 
while the VFO frequency is being changed, as well 
as on any band change. 
  If you’re using logging/contesting software, 
check with the manufacturer before setting 
AUTOINF to ANT CTRL. Some applications may 
not be tolerant of unsolicited “IF;” packets. 
CW/DATA Terminal Applications 
The KX3 directly supports CW/PSK31/RTTY 
ASCII text transmit and receive via its ACC1 port 
(RS232 or USB). Our KX3 Utility application 
includes a Terminal function that lets you use these 
modes with your computer’s keyboard and monitor. 
At the KX3, select FSK-D data submode for RTTY, 
and PSK-D for PSK31. Then follow the Help 
instructions within KX3 Utility. 
K3 Memory Program  
The KX3’s frequency memories (pg. 17) can be 
easily viewed and changed using our K3 Memory 
PC application. This program shows the contents of 
all 100 regular memories and the per-band quick-
memories in a spreadsheet format.  
You can also set VFO A directly to a memory from 
within the K3 Memory program.

Configuration 
You’ll need to set up Option Module Enables (see 
below) anytime you add one or more option 
modules. This is done at the factory for factory-
installed options.  
Some Menu Settings (beginning at right) should be 
set up before you use the KX3 on the air. 
 
Option Module Enables 
Whenever an option is installed, use the associated 
menu entry to set it up (see Menu Functions, pg. 
35). When installing internal options, open the 
KX3 enclosure using the procedure on pg. 23. 
§ 
KXAT3 Antenna Tuner (ATU): Set ATU MD 
to AUTO. Exit the menu and turn the KX3 off, 
then back on. See pg. 6 for recommended 
antennas and pg. 14 for ATU controls. 
§ 
KXFL3 Roofing Filter Module: Set RX XFIL 
to NOR. Exit the menu and turn the KX3 off 
for 5 seconds, then back on. You must then 
perform the  Receive Sideband calibration 
procedure (pg. 32). 
§ 
KXPD3 Keyer Paddle: Set CW KEY2 to 
LeFT paddle  = DOT (normal) or  = DASH 
(reverse). If you set it to HAND, either paddle 
can be used as a hand key. Note that the KEY 
jack on the left side panel is configured using 
the CW KEY1 menu entry. The device plugged 
into KEY is independent of the KXPD3. 
§ 
KXBC3 Internal NiMH Battery Charger:  
Set BAT CHG to CHG OFF. Exit the menu 
and turn the KX3 off for 5 seconds, then back 
on. See Internal Batteries (pg. 23) for battery 
recommendations and charging instructions. 
§ 
KX3-2M/4M Module: See 2M/4M and XVn 
menu entries and associated manual. 
§ 
KXPA100 External 100-W amplifier: See       
PA MODE menu entry and KXPA100 manual. 
§ 
PX3 Panadapter:  Set RX I/Q to ON. Also see 
PX3 manual. 
 
  After changing option enables, use KX3 
Utility to save your present configuration. The 
configuration can then be restored later if later 
required. 
 
Menu Settings 
The menu entries described in this section can be 
used to tailor KX3 operation to your own needs. 
You may also want to review the full list of menu 
entries, starting on pg. 35. 
  After changing menu settings, use KX3 
Utility to save your present configuration. The 
configuration can then be restored later if required. 
Audio Effects 
If you sometimes use stereo headphones or two 
external powered speakers, try setting the audio 
effects mode (AFX MD) to DELAY. (This has no 
effect on the internal speaker.) DELAY creates a 
simulated stereo effect that can reduce listening 
fatigue. If you encounter a pile-up of CW signals, 
try the PITCH setting, which “maps” signals from 
left to right in the audio space based on their pitch. 
AM and FM Mode Disable 
If you don’t plan to use AM and/or FM modes, you 
can disable them individually using the AM MODE 
and FM MODE menu entries.  
Auto Power-Off 
The KX3 can turn itself off after a specified period 
of inactivity (i.e., no use of the controls). This is 
most useful when the unit is running from a small 
battery. Use the AUTOOFF menu entry to select 
the time period in minutes. The default is 
INFINITE.  
  If battery charging is in progress, the KX3 
won’t turn itself completely off; it will “hibernate” 
until charging is complete (pg. 24). 
Low-Battery Warning 
You can set BAT MIN to warn you when an 
internal or external battery is approaching end of 
charge. BAT LOW is displayed periodically when 
this level is reached. The default voltage (10.0 V) 
is appropriate for many 12-V batteries. For 
suggested low-battery warning levels for other 
battery types, see the BAT MIN menu entry. 
The KX3 will turn itself off when the supply 
voltage drops below about 7.5 volts, regardless of 
the BAT MIN  setting.

Band Map 
If there are some bands you don’t plan to use, you 
can remove them from the band-switch rotation 
using BND MAP. This can save time when 
switching bands. Within the BND MAP menu 
entry, you can switch bands using BAND+ and 
BAND-.  Set each band to IN or OUT as desired.  
CW Iambic Mode 
CW users can specify Iambic mode A or B using 
the CW IAMB menu entry. The default is mode A, 
which is a little more forgiving for first-time 
operators. Mode B may be preferred by operators 
who learned to do “squeeze-keying” with another 
keyer having this or a similar mode. Both modes 
provide dot- and dash-memories—enabling fast 
code speeds—but with slightly different timing. 
Microphone Settings 
If you plan to use voice modes, set up MIC BIAS 
and MIC BTN to match your microphone (pg. 35). 
Preamp Gain (Per-Band) 
The default (and recommended) preamp gain is 20 
dB. However, you can select 10 dB if 20 dB is too 
much gain on a given band. (Operating with the 
preamp turned off may be a better choice in such 
cases.) The 10-dB preamp adds about 15 mA to 
receive-mode current drain, while the 20-dB 
preamp adds only about 5 mA.  
  A 30 dB selection is also available that turns 
on both preamps. However, this setting increases 
susceptibility to strong signals. It is the default 
setting on 6 meters, where the combination of the 
two can improve sensitivity by 1 to 2 dB. 
Switch press Tones 
Switch press tones are enabled by default. Using the            
SW TONE menu entry, you can turn tones OFF, 
ON, or select Morse code control tones at various 
speeds (CODE nn). The full list of Morse code 
control characters, as well as a text-only panel 
description for blind operators, can be found on our 
KX3 web page. 
Switch tones use the CW sidetone volume level, 
which can be adjusted in CW mode (pg. 12). 
Setting the Time 
MENU:TIME sets the 24-hour real-time-clock 
(RTC) if a KXBC3 module is installed. If no 
KXBC3 is installed, the displayed time will start at 
00:00:00 when the KX3 is turned on. 
While in the menu entry, tap  1 / 2 / 3 to select 
HH/MM/SS (hours/minutes/seconds), respectively. 
Then use VFO A to adjust the value. KX3 Utility 
can also be used to accurately set the time. 
Tap DISP and rotate VFO B to display the present 
time. 
VFO Setup 
Several menu entries are provided to control VFO 
behavior: 
§ 
VFO CRS sets up the KHZ tuning increment 
for each mode (coarse tuning) on a per-mode 
basis. 
§ 
VFO CTS specifies the number of counts per 
knob turn (VFO A and B): 128 or 256. The 
lower setting makes fine-tuning easier, 
especially for mobile use. The higher setting 
allows quicker tuning. 
§ 
VFO OFS, if set to YES, allows the OFS/VFO 
B knob to do coarse tuning of VFO A. (This 
only applies if the knob is not being used for 
RIT, XIT, or to select VFO B display modes. 
See pg. 35.) 
TUNE Power Level 
If you’re using an external antenna tuner or 
amplifier with the KX3, you may need to limit the 
power level used during TUNE. The TUN PWR 
menu entry can be used to set the desired power 
level. For example, with an Elecraft T1 ATU, the 
best tuner power level is about 3.0 watts.  
  If you have the KXAT3 internal ATU installed, 
power is automatically set to 3.0 watts during 
antenna tuning. There’s no need to configure      
TUN PWR for this purpose.  
VOX (Voice Operated Transmit) Setup 
If you plan to use VOX in voice modes, you’ll need 
to set up the VOX GN and VOX INH (anti-VOX) 
menu entries.

Calibration 
   Most calibration steps are performed at the 
factory for both kit and assembled KX3s.   
There is one exception: If you install a KXFL3 
roofing filter after initial purchase, you’ll need to 
perform the Receive Sideband calibration step 
(pg 32). 
Viewing tech-mode menu entries: To view the 
menu entries used during calibration, hold MENU, 
then rotate  
 OFS / VFO B  to locate the TECH 
MD menu entry. Use VFO A to change the 
parameter to ON.  
To unlock the parameter for a tech-mode menu 
entry: Hold KHZ until you see the lock symbol          
(
) turn off (about 3 seconds).  
Reference Frequency 
Using the calibration procedure below, you can 
achieve accuracy of better than +/- 1 ppm. This 
procedure requires a stable signal generator, or an 
on-air signal at a known frequency, such as WWV 
at 5, 10, or 15 MHz. The carrier of a commercial 
AM broadcast station can also be used. 
  If better frequency stability is desired, refer to 
the Extended VFO Temperature Compensation 
procedure, available on our KX3 web page. 
  During the procedure, you’ll have a choice of 
two methods for adjusting the reference frequency:        
(1) automatic tuning, or (2) manual tuning. 
Method (2) may be slightly more accurate but 
requires “zero-beating” of two signals, which some 
operators may find difficult to do.  
§ 
Select CW mode by tapping MODE.  
§ 
Hold MENU. Rotate  
 OFS / VFOB  to find 
DUAL RX. Set it to OFF, then exit the menu. 
§ 
If you’re using a signal generator, set  
 PWR 
to 0.0 watts to avoid damaging it.  
§ 
Use direct frequency entry (pg. 10) to set VFO 
A to the exact frequency of your signal 
generator or on-air signal source. This will also 
switch the KX3 to the required band. 
§ 
Set AF gain for a comfortable listening level. 
You should be able to hear a carrier. 
§ 
Method 1 (automatic tuning): Hold CWT. 
The upper half of the S-meter becomes a tuning 
aid, with the CWT icon turned on. This enables 
the auto-spot function to be used below.  
Method 2 (manual tuning): This method 
requires manually matching the pitch of the 
received signal to the CW sidetone pitch using 
SPOT. To prepare for this, you may need to 
increase sidetone volume. See pg. 12. 
§ 
Locate the I/II icons (right end of the filter 
passband graphic). If function II is selected, tap  
PBT I/II  to select function I (bandwidth).  
§ 
Rotate the  
 PBT I/II  control to set the 
bandwidth to 0.30 kHz (BW 0.30). 
§ 
Tap  PBT I/II  to switch to function II (shift). 
§ 
Rotate the  
 PBT I/II  control until the filter 
passband is centered in the filter graphic. 
§ 
Hold MENU, then rotate  
 OFS / VFOB  to 
locate the REF CAL menu entry.  
§ 
Hold KHZ for about 3 seconds to unlock the 
parameter (shown on VFO A). 
§ 
If you see only 7 digits, tap RATE.  
§ 
In case you decide to restore the factory setting, 
write down the full 8-digit parameter value:   
_________________ .  
§ 
Method 1 (automatic tuning, CWT on): Tap 
SPOT to auto-spot the signal. The REF CAL 
parameter value should automatically move up 
or down a small amount. When it finishes 
moving, the bar directly beneath the CWT icon 
should be turned on as shown below. The 
reference will then be closely calibrated. 
 
Method 2 (manual tuning, CWT off): Tap 
SPOT and manually adjust the REF CAL 
parameter using VFO A until the received 
signal pitch matches the sidetone pitch. Adjust 
for zero-beat.  
§ 
If you have difficulty with this procedure, or if 
you’re not sure that it worked correctly, set the 
parameter value to its original value (recorded 
above) using VFO A. 
§ 
If you have adjusted the REF CAL value more 
accurately, write down the new value (8 digits) 
here for future reference: ______________ .  
§ 
Exit the menu by holding MENU. 
§ 
Save your configuration using KX3 Utility.

Receive Sideband 
Receive sideband calibration nulls (rejects) the 
opposite-sideband image. This image is a weak 
audible side-effect of very strong signals. 
  This calibration step is done at the factory 
for KX3s shipped with the KXFL3 option at 
time of purchase, whether factory assembled or 
kit. It must be performed by the owner only if a 
KXFL3 is purchased and installed later. Please 
refer to the instruction sheet supplied with the 
KXFL3 option. 
 
Transmit Bias 
This automated procedure sets the transmit bias 
current of the 10-watt amplifier stage to ensure low 
distortion. No test equipment is required. 
 
§ 
Make sure nothing is connected to the KX3’s 
BNC antenna jack. 
§ 
Hold MENU, then rotate  
 OFS / VFOB  to 
locate the TX BIAS  menu entry. Hold KHZ for 
about 3 seconds to unlock the two parameters. 
Note: These parameters cannot be manually 
adjusted. 
§ 
Select CW mode by tapping MODE. 
§ 
Tap XMIT to start CW bias calibration. This 
may take 3-10 seconds. If an error message 
appears at the end (ERR nnn), see 
Troubleshooting. 
§ 
Select SSB mode (LSB or USB) by tapping 
MODE. 
§ 
Tap XMIT to start SSB bias calibration.  
§ 
Exit the menu by holding MENU. 
§ 
Save your configuration using KX3 Utility.

Transmit Gain  
This procedure compensates for per-band transmit 
gain variations at two different power levels, and 
must be done on every band. As described below, 
the procedure can be done manually, or you can use 
the a fully-automated procedure provided by the 
KX3 Utility program. A 6-watt (minimum) dummy 
load is required in either case. 
 
  A 12-14 volt external power supply or 
battery must be used during this procedure.   
Automated Transmit Gain Calibration 
§ 
If a computer is available, you can use the 
automated transmit gain calibration procedure. 
Connect the KX3 to the computer, run KX3 
Utility, and select the Calibration tab.  
§ 
Click on Calibrate Transmitter Gain and 
follow the on-screen instructions.  
§ 
Save your configuration using KX3 Utility.  
Manual Transmit Gain Calibration 
§ 
Use direct frequency entry (pg. 10) to set the 
KX3’s operating frequency to 1.9 MHz (160 
meters). 
§ 
If you have the KXAT3 ATU option installed, 
put it into bypass mode (MENU:ATU MD).     
§ 
Set the TUN PWR menu entry to NOR.  
§ 
Connect a dummy load to the BNC jack. 
§ 
Set  
 PWR  to exactly 4.0 watts (pg. 14). 
§ 
Hold TUNE; wait until VFO B shows 4.0 W.  
§ 
Tap XMIT to exit TUNE. 
§ 
Repeat the above procedure on 80-6 meters. 
Use approximately the following frequencies:  
3.7 MHz (80 m), 5.4 MHz (60 m), 7.1 MHz (40 
m), 10.1 MHz (30 m), 14.1 MHz (20 m), 18.1 
MHz (17 m), 21.2 MHz (15 m), 24.9 MHz (12 
m), 28.8 MHz (10 m), 52 MHz (6 m). 
§ 
Repeat transmit calibration at 6.0 W on all 
bands.

Transmit Carrier 
In SSB and some data modes, a transmitter’s 
primary signal may be accompanied by a weak 
unmodulated signal called a carrier about 1 kHz 
away. The carrier should be suppressed (or nulled) 
to minimize interference to nearby stations. The 
TXCRNUL menu entry is used for this purpose. 
  This procedure requires a spectrum analyzer 
and is normally done only at the factory. 
Complete instructions are available on request.  
 
Transmit Sideband 
In SSB and some data modes, a transmitter’s 
primary signal may be accompanied by a weak 
opposite sideband signal about 2 kHz away. This 
signal should be suppressed (or nulled) to minimize 
interference to nearby stations. The TXSBNUL 
menu entry is used for this purpose. 
  This procedure requires a spectrum analyzer 
and is normally done only at the factory. 
Complete instructions are available on request.

Menu Functions 
Hold  MENU  to enter the KX3’s menu. Tap or hold this switch to exit. Menu entries that you’d like quick 
access to can be assigned to programmable function switches (pg. 19). Note:  NOR appears in some parameter 
displays. This means “Normal,” i.e. the default or recommended value. 
Menu Help Information 
Holding  MENU  for about 3 seconds while in the menu shows information about the present menu entry on 
VFO B. For most entries, the default parameter value is shown in parentheses at the start of the help text. Tap 
the switch to terminate the help text display. 
Tech-Mode menu entries  
The 
 symbol in the table below indicates a tech mode menu entry. These are typically used for calibration, or 
should be changed with caution. Their parameter values are locked by default, as indicated by the lock symbol 
on the display. To see tech-mode menu entries, set  MENU:TECH MD  to ON. To change any tech-mode 
parameter, you must first unlock it by holding KHZ for about 3 seconds. This turns off the lock symbol. 
 
Entry 
Default 
Description 
2 TONE 
 
OFF 
Enables built-in 2-tone generator for SSB transmit tests. The internal 2-tone 
generator only works if LSB or USB mode is selected. After setting 2-tone ON, 
exit the menu and tap XMIT.  
2M/4M 
 
Not Inst 
If a KX3-2M or KX3-4M module is installed, set to NOR or to one of the 
SLEEP modes (see below). See XVn menu entries (or KX3-2M/4M installation 
manual) for additional setup instructions. 
SLEEP Settings:  SLEEP .25 (0.25 seconds) through SLEEP 1.0 (1.0 seconds) 
specify the sleep time between receive-signal checks when the receiver is in FM 
mode, and squelched. With these settings, receive-mode current drain decreases 
by up to 50%, extending operating time when using a small battery. 
Temperature Sensing: By default, KX3-2M/4M temperature sensing takes place 
in both RX and TX modes. To turn sensing off in transmit for diagnostic 
purposes, tap 1 to change the setting to TX TMP- instead of TX TMP+. 
ACC2 IO 
OFF 
Determines the function of the GPIO signal (ACC2 jack’s “tip” connection): 
OFF (output, 0 V), ON (output, 3 V), LO=PTT (input; apply 0 V or ground to 
activate PTT), HI=PTT (input; apply 3 to 5 V to activate PTT), LO=Inh (input; 
0 V inhibits transmit), HI=Inh (input; 3 to 5 V inhibits transmit), TRN CTRL 
(output; XV-series transverter control using Elecraft auxBus prototcol). If the 
GPIO signal is inhibiting transmit, the TX icon will flash as a reminder. 
NOTE: External interface circuitry may be required. The GPIO pin is a 3-V 
logic input/output with a 500-ohm series current-limiting resistor. It is tolerant of 
0-5.5 VDC when used as an input. If a voltage outside this range is to be used, 
insert a larger series resistor. (Example: when an RS232 RTS signal is used to 
activate PTT, use a 2.2 to 10 K series resistor.) When the GPIO pin is used as an 
output, its 3-V logic high may not be sufficient for use with some equipment. In 
this case a 3-V to 5-V level translation circuit can be used. 
AF LIM 
NOR 030 
Adjustable AF output limiter for use when AGC is turned off. This can protect 
your ears if a large signal appears. Signals or noise above the threshold will sound 
highly distorted due to the limiting action, reminding you to back down the AF or 
RF gain. Typical settings for those who often turn AGC off are 17 to 23; some 
experimentation will be required. 

============================================================
PAGE 36
============================================================

 
 
 
36 
 
 
AFX MD 
Delay 
Sets up stereo audio effects (requires stereo headphones or dual external 
speakers). Set to OFF for no effects.  DELAY is quasi-stereo, which provides a 
very rich audio sound. PITCH does left/right pitch mapping, which can be very 
effective in CW mode. 
AGC MD 
ON 
Some operators prefer to turn AGC off and control gain manually using the RF 
gain control; see pg. 12. (When AGC is off, the AGC icons on the LCD change to 
AGC- , with the “minus” sign meaning “off”.) If an uncomfortably-strong signal 
appears in your headphones or speaker, see AF LIM (AGC-off audio limiter). 
AGC SPD 
SLO 
This setting is stored per-mode. The default for CW mode is FAST, and for other 
modes, SLO. The setting is indicated by the AGC S and F display icons. 
AGC*THR 
007 
This menu entry provides access to several AGC parameters, each of which starts 
with  AGC*. For most purposes the defaults will suffice. Tap the 1 through 6 
switches to access the following parameters (defaults in parentheses):  
1  AGC*THR (005):  Threshold at which AGC action begins. A higher number 
moves the threshold up, providing greater audio dynamic range. 
2  AGC*ATK (215):  Rate of AGC attack. A lower number than the default 
provides a softer attack but may also result in overshoot.  
3  AGC*HLD (000):  Hold time in seconds for voice modes. Prevents AGC 
decay for a specified time after attack, reducing AGC interaction with signals. 
4  AGC*DCY (Fast, 140; Slow, 040):  Specifies the decay rate for slow or fast 
AGC (see AGC SPD menu entry). A larger number means a faster decay. 
5  AGC*SLP (015):  The higher the slope number, the "flatter" the AGC 
response is. With a high setting of slope, signals above the AGC threshold will be 
held close in audio amplitude even if they vary in strength at the RF input. 
6  AGC*PLS (NOR):   Noise pulse rejection. Prevents the AGC (and S-meter) 
from charging up on one-shot noise events. Set it to OFF to disable this feature. 
ALARM 
OFF 
Set alarm/Auto-Power-On time. Tap 1 to turn alarm on/off; tap 2 / 3 to set 
HH.MM. If a KXBC3 option module is installed and an internal battery is 
installed, time will be maintained when power to the transceiver is turned off. 
Otherwise the time registers will reset to 00:00:00 on power-up. 
At the alarm time, the KX3 will emit three short beeps. If power had been turned 
off, AF output will then be restored to the last-used level. 
AM MODE 
ON 
Set to OFF if AM operation is not planned. You can still copy AM signals using 
SSB modes even if AM is turned off. 
ATU MD 
ATU.X MD 
Not Inst 
KXAT3 (or KXAT100) ATU mode. If a KXPA100 is connected via the remote-
control cable, and PA MODE is ON, the ATU MD menu entry changes to ATU.X 
MD (X = eXternal). In this case the menu entry directly controls the mode of the 
KXPA100’s 100-W ATU (KXAT100), not the KX3’s low-power ATU (KXAT3).  
The parameter is normally set to BYP or AUTO. Modes L1-L8, C1-C8, and Ct 
are used to test the KXAT3’s relays and L-network (not applicable to the 
KXAT100). Tapping CLR clears stored LC data for the present band (applies to 
whichever ATU is in use, KXAT3 or KXAT100). 
AM Broadcast Band Optimization:  When a KXAT3 is installed, it normally 
provides additional filtering to reject “image” responses when listening to signals 
in the AM broadcast band (0.5-1.6 MHz). However, this may reduce recevier 
sensitivity below 1.3 MHz. If signals in the lower portion of the broadcast band 
are too weak, try tapping ‘1’ in this menu entry to select BCB=160 mode rather 
than BCB=NOR (default). BCB=160 causes the KXAT3 to use the normal 160-
meter LC settings when tuned anywhere in the broadcast band. 

============================================================
PAGE 37
============================================================

 
 
 
37 
 
 
AUTO INF 
 
NOR 
If set to ANT CTRL, the KX3 will send band data (“automatic info”) to its 
ACC1 jack for use with devices such as SteppIR™ antennas. The data is sent on 
every band change, and once per second if the VFO is being moved. See pg. 28. 
If set to RIG CTRL, the KX3 will function as a front panel for remote control of 
a second KX3 (or a K3) via an internet or wiFi connection. See pg. 28.  
AUTO OFF 
INFINITE Sets auto-power-off time in minutes (the timer is retriggered when any control is 
used, and during transmit). If set to INFINITE, power is never turned off. A 
setting of 5 or 10 minutes is recommended when running from batteries. 
BAT CHG 
Not Inst 
If the KXBC3 option is installed (NiMH charger and real-time clock), set to     
CHG OFF normally. To charge batteries, used one of the timed-charge settings. 
See KXBC3 manual for detailed information on battery charging. See pg. 24 for 
battery installation instructions. 
BAT MIN 
10.0 
Low-battery warning threshold. The default (10.0 volts) is sufficient for use with 
some 12 V batteries such as gel cells. For eight internal NiMH batteries, a setting 
of 8.5 V is recommended. For internal alkaline or nonrechargeable lithium 
batteries, use 9.0 V. If the internal battery or external supply/battery voltage 
drops below this level, the operator will be alerted with BAT LOW messages 
every few minutes. The KX3 will turn itself off if the supply voltage drops below 
7.0 V. For tips on extending battery life, see pg. 24. 
BKLIGHT 
ON 
LCD backlight on/off. The display is transflective, so it can be seen in sunlight 
with the backlight turned off. Turning it off will extend battery life. 
BND MAP 
{band} In 
Allows you to remove one or more bands from the BAND rotation. Use BAND 
up/down to select bands, then set them to In or Out using VFO A. (Works with 
transverter bands, too.) You can still get to mapped-out bands using memory 
recall, direct frequency entry, or computer-control commands. 
COR LVL 
 
NOR 0.1 
Sets the carrier-operated-relay (COR) threshold. The COR is used to detect, and 
protect the KX3’s receiver from, a transmitter being used nearby. 0.1 watts is the 
default and recommended level. See Troubleshooting for other suggestions. 
CW IAMB 
A 
Iambic keying mode (A or B). The default is mode A, which is a little more 
forgiving for first-time operators. Mode B may be preferred by operators who 
learned to do “squeeze-keying” with another keyer having this or a similar mode. 
Both modes provide dot- and dash-memories—enabling fast code speeds—but 
with slightly different “element-insert” timing. 
CW KEY1 
TIP=DOT 
Specifies whether the left keyer paddle (tip contact on the KEY jack) is DOT or 
DASH. A third selection, HAND, allows either tip or ring to function as a hand 
key, or as an input for an external keying device (keyer, computer, etc.). 
CW KEY2 
LFT=DOT 
Specifies whether the left lever of the optional KXPD3 keyer paddle is DOT or 
DASH. A third selection, HAND, allows either lever to function as a hand key, 
or as an input for an external keying device (keyer, computer, etc.). 
CW WGHT 
1.25 
Adjusts element/space timing ratio (weight) for the internal keyer. Also: 
Tap 1 to select SSB -CW (default) or SSB +CW (allows CW in SSB modes). 
With SSB +CW, tapping KEYER/MIC knob in SSB mode alternates between 
keyer speed and mic gain. CW TX in SSB mode is not available if SPLIT is on. 
Tap 4 to select VOX NOR (default) or AUTO OFF. The AUTO OFF setting 
turns CW VOX off on power-up, avoiding accidental keying by attached PCs, etc. 
Tap 5 to select automatic VFO offset on SSB/CW mode change (VFO OFS) or 
no offset (VFO NOR, default). Automatic offset is often used on 6 meters, where 
mixed-mode QSOs are necessary during fading.  Note:  Pitch matching will be 
more accurate if USB is paired with CW REV, and LSB with CW normal.  

============================================================

DUAL RX 
OFF 
Set to AUTO to enable Dual Watch (pg. 20). The SUB icon will turn on. If the 
VFOs are not within the required range, the SUB icon will flash slowly. Note: 
Dual watch only applies when using stereo headphones or dual external speakers. 
FM DEV 
 
5.0 
FM voice deviation in kHz.  Tap 1 to change the function to PL DEV (PL tone 
deviation; default 0.36 kHz). To turn on PL tones, use PITCH (pg. 15). 
FM MODE 
ON 
If set to OFF, FM will be removed from the mode selections. 
FW REVS 
 
N/A 
Rotate VFO A to see firmware revision: µC (microcontroller), dSP, and PA 
(KXPA100). Tap 1 to see RF PC board revision. 
LCD TST 
OFF 
Rotate VFO A to turn on all LCD segments for test purposes. 
LED BRT 
4 
In the case where the LCD backlight is turned OFF, this menu entry adjusts 
brightness of the discrete LEDs (TX, delta-F, OFS, and VFO B LED). Does not 
set brightness of the LCD backlight itself (for that adjustment, use BKLIGHT). 
MACRO n 
Function 
Used to assign macros (sequence of remote-control commands) to either of the 
KX3’s programmable function switches (PF1 and PF2). For example, a single 
macro can do the equivalent of “SPLIT, up 2 kHz, turn on Dual Watch”, etc. 
Macros must first be created using KX3 Utility and sent to the KX3. Refer to 
KX3 Utility’s Help information for instructions and examples. 
MIC BIAS 
ON 
Set to ON for the Elecraft MH3. You may need to try both MIC BIAS settings to 
see which works best. Monitor signal with another receiver when testing audio. 
MIC BTN 
PTT 
UP.DN 
If your mic has both a PTT switch and UP/DN buttons, set the parameter to             
PTT UP.DN. This applies to the Elecraft MH3. If the mic has PTT but no UP/DN 
buttons, use PTT. Otherwise, use OFF. This applies to most headset-mics, 
including the Heil models available from Elecraft. Third-party mics may not have 
a KX3-compatible PTT (push-to-talk) switch. You can still key the transmitter 
either by tapping the XMIT switch or by using VOX (pg. 15). 
MSG RPT 
6 
Message repeat interval in seconds (0 to 255). To repeat a message, hold M1 – 
M4 rather than tap. A 6 - 10 sec. interval is about right for casual CQing. Shorter 
intervals may be needed during contests, and longer for periodic CW beacons. 
PA MODE 
OFF 
Sets the operating mode for Elecraft KXPA100 amplifier and its internal ATU.  
Set to ON only if the KX3 is connected to the KXPA100 via the KX3 control 
cable, which plugs into the ACC1 and ACC2 jacks at the KX3. This allows the 
KX3 to control the amplifier’s output power, ATU tuning, antenna switch, etc. as 
described in the KXPA100 owner’s manual. ATU MD becomes ATU.X MD. 
Set to OFF otherwise. This allows the KX3 to be used with the KXPA100 
without the custom control cable, but an amp keying connection is still required 
from ACC2 on the KX3 to KEY IN on the amplifier.  
If PA MODE is set to P out CAL, a KXPA100 is connected via the remote-
control cable, and PWR is set to CAL 75W, going into TUNE mode will calibrate 
the KX3’s drive level for 75 W output at the KXPA100, on the present band. This 
overrides the KXPA100’s factory aligned, per-band drive-power calibration, and 
should not be necessary under normal circumstances. Also see MENU:TX GAIN.  
PA ALC: Tap 1 to turn PA ALC on/off (the default is on, or PA ALC+). When 
PA ALC is on, and KXPA100 power is set to 70 W or less (at the KX3), the 
operator can use the KX3’s TUNE switch function to more accurately set the 
amplifier’s output level. Refer to the KXPA100 manual for details. 
Transient Fault Display:  Transient KX3-to-KXPA100 communication errors 
are normally corrected without alerting the operator. For diagnostic purposes, 
they can be displayed as “FAULT nnn” where nnn is a 3-digit number originating 
from the KXPA100. To enable this, tap 6 until you see XFAULT+.

PBT SSB 
Lo-Hi Cut 
Sets up the PBT I and II receive filter functions for SSB mode. Lo Cut and Hi 
Cut (functions I and II, respectively) are the defaults for SSB. If PBT SSB is set 
to NOR, then SSB mode will have the same PBT funcitons as CW and DATA 
modes (WIDTH and SHIFT). 
Roofing Filter Configuration for SSB Mode: Roofing filter FL2 (3 kHz) can be 
inserted when the upper edge of the receive passband reaches either 2.4 kHz 
(default value) or 2.9 kHz. When the passband edge is higher than this, FL1 is 
used (wide filter). (If no KXFL1 is installed, FL1 is always used.) 
If you frequently encounter QRM in SSB modes, use the 2.9 kHz selection; this 
will insert FL2 when the normalized passband width is used (NORM switch). If 
QRM is less of an issue or you frequently use ESSB, use the 2.4 kHz selection 
(original value); this will insert FL1 at the NORM setting. The PBT knob can 
override either selection (see below). To select the desired FL2 insertion point: 
Tap ‘1’ to select either 2.4 or 2.9 kHz using the criteria above.  
Note on SSB demodulation methods used for FL1 vs. FL2:  When FL1 is in 
selected (wide filter), the KX3 uses conventional SSB demodulation, providing 
the best overall audio fidelity. When FL2 is selected (3 kHz filter), the KX3 uses 
“Weaver” SSB demodulation, which introduces a narrow 1.5 kHz notch into the 
receive passband as part of the DSP algorithm. This notch typically has no impact 
on speech intelligibility, but it can sound slightly different to an operator who is 
most concerned about fidelity. 
PREAMP 
20 dB 
Sets preamp gain to 10, 20, or 30 dB on a per-band basis. (30 dB is typically 
used only on 6 meters, where it improves sensitivity by 1-2 dB. This setting 
should only be used if necessary, since it increases susceptibility to overload.)  
There are actually two preamps: the 20 dB low noise amp (LNA) and the 10 dB 
setting of the isolation amp (see RX ISO, below). Use the 20-dB preamp when 
possible, since it has a better noise figure and lower current drain. If you select 10 
or 30 dB, the isolation amp is turned on, adding about 15 mA to current drain. 
REF CAL 
 
114.nnn.nn 
Used to calibrate the KX3’s synthesizer; normally this is done at the factory. VFO 
A is used to set the reference frequency (typically 114.2-114.4 MHz). Refer to pg. 
31 for calibration details.  
Note: If the menu name is REF*CAL, then an extended VFO temperature 
compensation procedure has been performed. This may be helpful when JT65, 
WSPR, or other modes are used with the KX3, especially on the higher bands. 
Instructions can be found on our website. 
Tapping ATTN disables synthesizer temperature compensation (“TC OFF”), 
changing REF CAL to REF#CAL, and OSC xxC (temp. display) to OSC#xxC. 
RPT OFS 
600 
Sets the transmit offset (in kHz) for repeater operation, from 0 to 5000 kHz. 
Stored per-band and per-memory. Use ALT to select +/- offset or simplex. 
RS232 
4800 b 
RS232 (or USB) communications rate in bits per second (bps). During firmware 
download (via the KX3FW PC program), the baud rate is set automatically to 
38400 baud, but it is then restored to the value selected in this menu entry. 
RX EQ 
 
--------   
(+0 dB, 
each 
band) 
Receiver audio graphic equalizer. VFO A is used as an 8-band bar graph, showing 
boost or cut (-16 dB to +16 dB in 1 dB increments) for each AF band. The 8 
bands are 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.4 and 3.2 kHz. Tap 1-8 to select an AF 
band. VFO A selects boost/cut. Hold  CLR to reset all bands to +0 dB. 
CW and voice mode RX EQ are separate. Not applicable to DATA modes. 
RX I/Q 
OFF 
Set to ON to use the KX3’s RX I/Q jack with the Elecraft PX3 Panadapter, or 
with SDR (software-defined radio) applications (pg. 26). 

============================================================
PAGE 40
============================================================

 
 
 
40 
 
 
RX ISO 
 
OFF 
Set to ON if you’re using the KX3 nearby other receivers operating on the same 
band, and a strong carrier from the KX3 is heard when its VFO is tuned to the 
same frequency as the other receiver’s. The isolation amplifier is between the 
antenna jack and the mixer, preventing leakage from the KX3’s local oscillator. 
RX NR p 
 
CW: 
B=5 
D=240 
M=250 
 
Voice: 
B=20 
D=240 
M=250 
 
 
Note 1: Most operators will not need to use this menu entry, which provides fine 
control of receive noise-reduction parameters. The NR switch function provides 
convenient control of the most important parameter (wet/dry mix); see pg. 13. 
Note 2: Even if you do set up NR parameters using this menu entry, you’ll still 
need to use the NR switch to turn NR on/off.  
Note 3: NR is not available in DATA modes or when AGC is off (see AGC MD).  
Note 4: Holding CLR while in this menu entry will restore all NR defaults. 
The letter <p> in the menu name will be either B (beta), D (decay), or M (wet/dry 
mix). Tap 1, 2, or 3, respectively, to select these parameters. Beta and Decay 
affect the depth of noise reduction and the time required for the DSP’s algorithm 
to settle. The defaults are recommended, and are stored separately for CW and 
voice modes. Mix controls how much of the signal is processed (wet) vs. how 
much is unprocessed (dry). This parameter should be used to set the overall 
receive noise reduction effect. The NR switch function directly controls the mix. 
RXSBNUL 
 
GAIN nnn Used to null (reject) the opposite-sideband image signal of each of the KX3’s 
analog filter paths. If the menu name is RXSBNL*, then an extended per-band 
calibration procedure has been completed. Normally this is done at the factory. 
This procedure requires a 160-6 meter signal source (such as an Elecraft XG3); 
instructions are available on our website. 
Also see Receive Sideband calibration, pg. 32. 
RX SHFT 
 
NOR 
Normally the KX3’s receive I.F. is 0.0 kHz (NOR setting). If a nearby transmitter 
(or automobile DC power noise) causes audible artifacts in the KX3’s receiver, 
the I.F. can be shifted up to 8.0 kHz to reduce or eliminate such artifacts. With 
this setting, dual watch and roofing filters cannot be used. This setting is per-
band, and should only be used on affected bands. 
RX XFIL 
Not Inst 
Set to NOR if a KXFL3 filter module is installed. The RXSBNUL calibration 
procedure must be performed when this module is installed (pg. 32). 
SER NUM 
N/A 
Your KX3’s serial number, e.g. 05000. Cannot be changed. 
SMTR MD 
 
NOR 
S-meter mode: When set to NOR, turning the preamp or attenuator on/off will 
affect the S-meter reading. If set to ABS, the S-meter reading will stay fairly 
constant with different preamp and attenuator settings. 
SW TEST 
 
OFF 
To turn on switch test, rotate VFO A until the parameter becomes SCN ADC. 
Then hold any switch to see its scan row and column ADC reading. You can also 
rotate any of the four potentiometers to see their associated ADC readings 
(main/sub AF gain and main/sub RF gain). If the SUB RF pot is mapped to 
main/sub squelch, you must switch to FM mode to see its readings. 
SW TONE 
ON 
If set to ON, switch presses generate audible tones. If set to CODE nn, Morse 
code characters are generated on any control activation at nn words per minute. 
(The full list of Morse code control characters, as well as a text-only panel 
description for blind operators, can be found on our KX3 web page.) 
Switch tone volume is the same as CW sidetone volume, adjusted with  
 MON.  
Pitch of switch tones and Morse characters: In general, a low-to-high tone pair 
(or high-pitched Morse) is generated when a switch function is turned on, and 
high-to-low (or low-pitched Morse) when it is turned off. 
Some switches do not generate tones because they might interfere with received 
or transmitted audio. 

============================================================
PAGE 41
============================================================

 
 
 
41 
 
 
TECH MD 
OFF 
Set to ON to view Tech Mode menu entries (those marked with 
 in this list). 
 
TIME 
N/A 
Real-time-clock view/set. Tap 1 / 2 / 3 to set HH / MM / SS. To see the time and 
other displays during normal operation, tap DISP  (see pg. 11). Time is only 
maintained if a KXBC3 option module and an internal battery are installed. 
TUN PWR 
NOR 
If set to NOR, TUNE power level follows the POWER knob. Otherwise, the 
parameter sets a fixed power level (0-10 W) for TUNE, overriding the present 
POWER knob setting.  
Note: TUN PWR does not pertain to ATU TUNE, which uses 2 or 3 W 
(KXAT3) or 5 W (KXAT100).  
TX BIAS 
 
ppp   qqq 
Transmit bias constants. See Transmit Bias, pg. 32. 
TXCRNUL 
 
1   nnnn 
Used at the factory to null the transmit carrier on each band. See Transmit 
Carrier, pg. 34.  
TX DLY 
HF NOR 
TRN NOR 
Varies the delay in milliseconds between key-down and RF output. This is useful 
with external power amplifiers having slow T/R relays (use NOR with the 
KXPA100 if there is no following higher-power amplifier). There are two TX 
DLY settings: one for HF-6 m (HF) and the other for transverter bands (TRN). 
NOR (5 ms) is recommended in most cases. A delay of up to 20 ms can be set, 
but use the smallest delay possible since longer delays can add some timing 
variation in CW mode at higher code speeds. 
TX EQ 
 
+0 dB, 
each band 
Transmit audio graphic equalizer (voice modes only). Functions the same as RX 
EQ, above. TX EQ can be adjusted during transmit. SSB TX EQ is separate from 
TX EQ for other voice modes. Not applicable to CW or DATA modes. 
  Do not use high settings of TX EQ without carefully monitoring your 
signal. Most microphones, including the Elecraft MH3, will provide good 
audio quality with little or no TX EQ. High settings can cause distortion. 
TX ESSB 
OFF  3.0 
Extended SSB transmit bandwidth (3.0 to 4.0 kHz) or OFF. Tap 1 to turn on/off 
and rotate VFO A to select the bandwidth. (Also see pg. 22.) 
TX GAIN 
 
 ALC   nn 
Shows whether transmit ALC (automatic level control) is enabled, along with the 
transmit gain constant for the present band and power setting (nn). Two gain 
constants are used: one for PWR settings of 5.0 watts or less, and the other for 
PWR settings of 5.1 watts or higher. The gain constants are calibrated whenever 
the TUNE function is activated at exactly 4.0 or 6.0 W. See Transmit Gain 
calibration procedure, pg. 33.  
If a KXPA100 is connected via the remote-control cable, PA MODE is ON, and 
PWR is 10 W or higher, the TX GAIN parameter shows the KX3 drive level for 
75 W output at the KXPA100. If the drive value is preceded by a the letter ‘A’, it 
was obtained from the KXPA100 (factory calibration value). If the drive value is 
preceded by the letter ‘t’, it was obtained by doing P out CAL at 75 W at the 
KX3 itself (see MENU:PA MODE). Holding CLR will erase the KX3’s CAL 
value on the present band, restoring the ‘A’ value (from the KXPA100). 
Transmit ALC can be turned off for 2-tone testing or other purposes by tapping 
DLY while in this menu entry. (This is NOT necessary for any operational 
purpose. In DATA modes, ALC is already optimized for low distortion.) When 
ALC is turned off, a (-) sign is added to the parameter, e.g. -ALC  nn. Also, an 
asterisk is added to the PWR control value when it is being adjusted (e.g. 5.0 
W*). In this case, the displayed power level will not change; the control functions 
as a fine power adjustment, and its effect should be observed with an external 
instrument. 

============================================================

TX GATE  
OFF  0 
The TX noise gate can be used to suppress transmitted audio below a certain 
level, e.g. that of an amplifier fan. Tap 1 within the TX GATE menu entry to turn 
the noise gate on/off. Use VFO A to set the desired threshold. Since there’s no 
visual indication that transmit audio is below the threshold, you should adjust it 
using the transmit voice monitor (MON), ideally while using headphones. Set the 
threshold high enough to cut off transmit audio due to local noise, but not so high 
that it causes your voice to drop out too frequently. 
 
TXSBNUL 
 
GAIN nnn Set at factory to null transmit opposite sideband. See Transmit Sideband, pg. 34. 
VFO CRS 
Per-mode 
Coarse tuning rate (hold KHZ , tune VFO A or B). Applies to the RIT/XIT tuning 
knob if MENU:VFO OFS is set to ON, and both RIT and XIT are turned off. 
VFO CTS 
256 
VFO counts per turn. Use 128 for easier fine-tuning of VFO; use 256 for faster 
tuning. Note: The KHZ tuning rate always uses 128 counts per turn. 
VFO NR 
 
OFF 
VFO tuning noise reduction. If VFO tuning noise is heard on a given band, set to 
ON. The setting is stored per-band. Typically it would be used only on 6 meters 
or other high-frequency bands. (Also see RX SHFT.) 
VFO OFS 
ON 
If ON, the RIT/XIT offset control can be used to tune VFO A in large steps when 
RIT / XIT are off and the OFS function of the OFS/VFO B knob is selected. Step 
sizes vary by mode (see VFO CRS), and are the same as the KHZ tuning rates. 
VOX GN 
030 
Adjusts sensitivity of VOX to match your mic and voice. Set to trigger at normal 
speech level, but not in response to noise. Start with low settings (10-20). 
VOX INH 
000 
Adjusts immunity of the VOX circuit to false triggering by speaker audio. (Also 
known as anti-vox.) A setting of about 30 is a good starting point. If receive audio 
from a speaker trips the vox, increase the setting. 
WATTMTR 
 
0.84 
Wattmeter calibration parameter. The default setting is recommended. If an 
external, known-accurate wattmeter reads lower than the KX3’s wattmeter, 
decrease the parameter value (and vice-versa). Note: The ATU (KXAT3), even 
when bypassed, may cause a small amount of loss (typically less than 0.5 dB). 
Internal wattmeter accuracy may vary by up to 1 dB, varying with band. 
XVn ON  
 
NO 
Tap 1 – 9 to select the applicable transverter band (1 - 9). Set parameter to YES 
to turn the transverter band on. 
XVn RF 
 
144 
Lower edge for transverter band <n> (1-9); 0-24999 MHz. (Tap 1 – 9 to select 
applicable transverter band.) Use 144 for the KX3-2M internal 2-m module, and 
70 for the KX3-4M 4-meter module. 
XVn IF 
 
28 
Specify KX3 band to use as the I.F. for transverter band <n> (1-9). (Tap 1 – 9 to 
select the transverter band.) I.F. selections include 7, 14, 21, 28, and 50 MHz. 
Use 50 MHz for the KX3-2M 2-m module, and 21 for the 4-meter module. 
XVn PWR 
 
H 0.1 
Sets upper limit on power level in watts for XVTR band <n>. Tap 1 – 9 to select 
band. 
The KX3 does not have a low-level transverter port, so external transverters must 
have their own T/R switching and be able to handle the specified power level. 
XVn OFS 
 
0.00 
Offset (–9.99 to +9.99 kHz) for transverter band n (1-9). (Tap 1 – 9 to select 
transverter band.) Compensates for oscillator/multiplier chain errors in external 
transverters. Not applicable to the internal KX3-2M/4M module, which derives its 
signal from the KX3’s synthesizer. 
 
 
 
 
 

============================================================
PAGE 43
============================================================

 
 
 
43 
 
 
XVn ADR 
 
TRNn  
Assigns optional band-decode addresses to transverter bands. Addresses TRN1-7 
can be used to select Elecraft XV-series transverters if the ACC2 IO menu entry 
is set to TRN CTRL and the transverters are connected to the ACC2 jack 
(tip=auxBus, ring=key out). TRN0 is used with the KX3-2M/4M module 
(internal). Tap 1 – 9 to select the transverter band; rotate VFO A to select the 
address.  
To configure an Elecraft KX3-2M 2-meter module as XVTR band 1, set  XV1 
ON to YES, XV1 RF to 144 MHz, XV1 IF to 50 MHz, and XV1 ADR to INT 
TRN0. For the KX3-4M module, use 70 MHz for RF and 21 MHz for the IF. The 
XV1 OFS menu entriy is not applicable in either case. Set and XV1 PWR to the 
desired maximum power output on 2 or 4 meters, in watts (max 3.0; reduce power 
if 2- or 4-meter antenna SWR is poor or when using internal batteries).

Troubleshooting 
The most common symptoms and their causes are listed below, in three categories (general, transmit,  and 
receive). Most problems are related to control settings. If the problem persists, please contact Elecraft support 
(see pg. 55) or post a question on our email reflector.  
General  
§ 
MCU LD shown on LCD and TX LED flashing: Do a forced firmware load (pg. 25). 
§ 
*****  shown on LCD permanently:  This indicates that the KX3 did not power-down correctly. 
Disconnect power for a few seconds, then try a forced firmware load (pg. 25).  
§ 
Display backlight turns on, but then turns off on release of switches: Disconnect all external equipment 
from the KX3. Verify power supply or battery voltage is between 9 and 15 V. Open enclosure and make 
sure cable between the two main PC boards is fully plugged in at both ends. 
§ 
ERR nnn (error) message appears in the VFO B area: Refer to Error Messages (pg. 47). If  a large 
number of error messages are seen at power-on, re-seat the flex cable between the RF and control boards. 
§ 
PA FLT (power amplifier fault) message appears in the VFO B area:  See KXPA100 owner’s manual. 
§ 
BAT LOW is flashed periodically: Check the battery voltage (tap DISP and rotate VFO B until the supply 
voltage display appears). If the batteries are at their normal voltage, you may have MENU:BAT MIN set to 
the wrong low-battery warning level. See this menu entry for recommendations. 
§ 
Can’t turn power on: Check the power cable. If running from internal batteries, make sure they’re 
installed, seated properly, oriented in the right direction, and charged.  
§ 
Can’t turn power off: If the display remains on, or the unit is otherwise unresponsive, disconnect the 
power supply. (If internal batteries are in use, also remove one battery.) Allow 5-10 seconds, then reconnect 
power and try turning the unit on. 
§ 
General problem with transmit and/or receive: Many problems can be caused by low power supply 
voltage or by a noisy or intermittent supply. Check your power supply’s on/off switch, voltage, fuses (if 
applicable), and DC cabling. The KX3 provides both voltage and current monitoring (pg. 11). Also see 
Transmit and Receive troubleshooting sections, below. 
§ 
General problem with firmware behavior: (1) Check all menu settings (see menu listings in the previous 
section). Hold MENU for about 3 seconds to see help information about each menu entry. (2) Try loading 
the latest microcontroller and DSP firmware. Review the release notes for changes that may be related to 
your symptoms. (3) If the above suggestions don’t help, try reinitializing the firmware (pg. 46). Be sure to 
save your configuration first, using KX3 Utility. 
§ 
Bands missing from BAND switch rotation: See MENU:BND MAP. 
§ 
N/A message (Not Applicable): The function you’re trying to use does not apply in the present context. 
§ 
Mode icon flashes: This is a reminder that you’re about to set the KX3 up for cross-mode SPLIT operation 
(VFOs in different modes). Tap any key to clear. To view and change VFO B’s mode, tap A / B. 
§ 
VFO A frequency doesn’t change:  You may have the VFO locked. Tap RATE to unlock. 
§ 
VFO A frequency changes by itself: (1) If using a mic other than the MH3, set MIC BTN to OFF. (2) If 
necessary, adjust the VFO A knob height so that the knob contacts the felt pad (see pg. 24).  
Transmit 
§ 
BND END: Attempt to transmit out of the allowed ham band. 

============================================================
PAGE 45
============================================================

 
 
 
45 
 
 
§ 
TX LED on all the time: This could indicate that PTT is being held on by external equipment. Try 
disconnecting everything connected to the left side panel except the power supply. VOX gain (VOX GN 
menu entry) may be set too high. Also check the ACC2 IO menu setting. 
§ 
HI CUR or HI SWR warning: Check supply voltage. If voltage is low and/or a low-impedance antenna 
load is present, current can go up for a given requested power level. Reduce power if necessary. (The KX3 
may do this automatically. If this doesn’t reduce the current or reflected power to safe levels, the KX3 will 
drop out of transmit mode.) 
§ 
HI TEMP warning: PA heat sink temperature has exceeded the safe operating limit. Use DISP to check 
power supply voltage, current drain, and PA temperature. Allow heat sink to cool. Reduce power if 
necessary. (The KX3 may automatically reduce power, drop out of transmit mode, or turn itself off.) 
§ 
KX3 enclosure is hot to the touch on the back edge: During hand-held or lap-top operation at high power 
or high duty cycle, the enclosure may feel uncomfortably warm. Reduce power or use shorter transmissions. 
Note: At 3.0 watts or lower, the KX3 uses a high-efficiency (lower-current) transmit mode, reducing the 
rate of heating and extending battery life. 
§ 
An asterisk (*) appears in the PWR setting display (e.g. 5.0 W*): Transmit ALC has been turned off. To 
turn it back on, go to MENU:TX GAIN , unlock the parameter by holding KHZ for 3 seconds, then tap 
DLY. This will turn off the (-) sign in front of ALC.  
§ 
Can’t transmit in any mode: The ACC2 IO menu entry may be set to HI=INH (transmit inhibit when the 
GPIO pin is pulled high or is floating high). 
§ 
Can’t transmit in CW mode: (1) Make sure the key or keyer paddle is plugged into the correct jack.        
(2) To transmit immediately upon hitting the key, you must have VOX-CW enabled (hold VOX) . If VOX is 
off (PTT-CW), you must tap XMIT before sending; otherwise only a sidetone is generated . (3) You may be 
in SPLIT mode, with VFO B set for a voice or data mode. Tap A/B to check VFO B’s mode. 
§ 
Can’t use the mic in voice modes: You may be in SPLIT mode, with VFO B set for CW or data mode 
rather than a voice mode. Tap A/B to check VFO B’s mode. 
§ 
Low power output: (1) Make sure transmit is not inhibited (see ACC2 IO menu entry); (2) try redoing the 
automated Transmit Gain calibration procedure (pg. 33). Note:  Max power varies by band (pg. 54). 
§ 
Inadequate transmit carrier or opposite-sideband suppression: The voice- and audio-data carrier and 
opposite sideband will typically be down 60 dB or more at 10 watts output.  If either is significantly higher 
than this level, the Transmit Carrier or Transmit Sideband calibration steps (pg. 34 and 34) must be 
performed. These procedures require a spectrum analyzer and are normally done only at the factory. 
Receive 
§ 
HI RFI warning, preamp turns off, or RX icon turns on:  The KX3 protects itself from high received 
signal levels. First, the preamp is turned off, if it was on. (You may be able to avoid this by using the 10-dB 
preamp rather than the 20-dB preamp on the current band. See MENU:PREAMP.) The second step taken 
by the KX3, if necessary, is to turn on a 15-dB attenuator stage in the I.F. section, ahead of the receiver’s A-
to-D converter. The receive overload icon (RX), near the ANT icon, will turn on. Once signals return to a 
safe level for 5 seconds, this attenuator will be turned back off. Also see COR (next item). 
§ 
Carrier-operated relay activated (a relay is heard, and the RX icon turns on): The carrier-operated-
relay (COR) may be activated due to the signal from a nearby transmitter. This is usually due to close 
proximity between your antenna and the other station’s antenna. The COR is actually the relay for the 
present low-pass filter. When the relay opens, signals will drop by 40 to 60 dB, protecting the KX3. The 
relay will close again shortly after the signal drops. If the COR is being repeatedly activated, try moving the 
antennas farther apart. You can also increase the COR threshold, at your discretion; see MENU:COR LVL. 
§ 
HI CUR warning:  Usually indicates speaker volume is too high; gain is reduced by the KX3 in this case.  
§ 
No received signal: Check (1) antenna connectors; (2) squelch (FM mode); (3) RF gain too low (set RF 
gain control fully clockwise, to –0 dB); (4) bandwidth too narrow (PBT I/II control); (5) MENU:REF CAL 
parameter not adjusted properly; (6) KXFL3 menu entry set to NOR but module not installed.

Received signal level too low: (1) check headphone and speaker plugs and cables; (2) make sure that 
MENU:RX EQ has not been set for large cuts; (3) verify that MENU:REF CAL is properly adjusted; (4) 
make sure RF gain is set to maximum; (5) preamp set to 10 dB rather than 20 dB (MENU:PREAMP). 
§ 
Spurious signals (“birdies”):  All receivers exhibit some birdies. Most will be inaudible with an antenna 
connected. In the KX3, there may be significant birdies or harmonics of birdies at the following frequencies 
due to internal signal sources: 16000 and 18432 +/- 5 kHz (MCU and DSP clock frequencies), 300-900 kHz 
(DC-DC converter oscillators, CMOS RF switches). In the unlikely event that a birdie interferes with 
operation, try CW reverse, manual notch, or (in voice modes) auto-notch. 
§ 
Opposite-sideband images heard: Opposite-sideband suppression is 50-60 dB. If images appear too high 
in amplitude, carefully redo the Receive Sideband calibration procedure (pg. 32).  If sideband image 
rejection is poor only for FL2 and/or FL3, but not FL1, the KXFL3 roofing filter module may be at fault. 
§ 
VFO tuning noise heard:  Set VFO NR (VFO noise reduction) to ON on the affected band, and/or set       
RX SHFT to 8.0. Even with these settings there may be very weak tuning noise heard, especially when no 
antenna is connected. Dual RX and roofing filters are disabled on any band where RX SHFT is set to 8.0. 
§ 
Mobile installation noise: If the 12-V DC accessory jack in a vehicle causes interference to the KX3’s 
receiver, try setting RX SHFT to 8.0 on the affected band(s).  
§ 
Low-level signals are heard that don’t change as the VFO is rotated: In a zero-I.F. receiver, it’s possible 
for extremely strong signals to create audible artifacts, due to AM detection at the mixer, that are not 
affected by tuning the VFO. If this occurs, first try turning off the preamp (and/or turning on the attenuator). 
Another alternative is to set the RX SHFT menu entry to 8.0 (kHz) on the affected band(s), although with 
this setting, dual watch cannot be used. If the source of such signals is a nearby transmitter (such as at Field 
Day), you may be able to reorient or move one of the antennas, or use an external band-pass filter. 
§ 
KX3 VFO signal is heard in a nearby receiver: If a nearby receiver is picking up the KX3’s VFO signal, 
turn on the isolation amp (RX ISO menu entry). Note: This increases current drain by about 15 mA if the 
isolation amp was not already being used as a 10-dB preamp. Turn RX ISO off when not needed. 
§ 
Internal speaker distortion at high volume: The KX3’s small internal speaker is not intended for use in 
high-noise environments, such as in a vehicle or outdoors in high winds. If audible artifacts occur at higher 
volume levels, switch to headphones or an external speaker. (Stereo also allows the use of audio effects.) If 
you hear distortion products even at low levels, verify that the speaker plug is inserted exactly as shown in 
Fig. 17 of the KX3 assembly manual. Also try loading new firmware (rev 1.41 or later improves audio). 
§ 
AM broadcast signals in the 300-700 kHz range appear to be off-frequency: Broadcast signals that 
appear not to tune in at even multiples of 1 kHz may be images of signals higher up in the band. You can 
eliminate most images by installing the KXAT3 ATU option, which includes broadcast band filtering.  
Parameter Initialization (EEINIT) 
It is possible, though rare, for EEPROM parameters to become altered in such a way as to prevent the firmware 
from running correctly. If you suspect this, you can reinitialize parameters to defaults, then restore a previously-
saved configuration (or re-do configuration steps manually; no test equipment is required). To initialize: 
§ 
IMPORTANT:   Run the KX3 Utility program and use the Save Configuration function to save your 
present firmware configuration. (Otherwise, you’ll need to re-do calibration steps after EEINIT.) 
§ 
Turn the KX3 off (using the KX3’s on/off switch combination, not your power supply). 
§ 
While holding in the PBT I/II knob with your right hand (which is also labeled NORM below the knob), 
turn power on with your left hand by holding BAND- and ATU TUNE together for about 2 seconds, then 
release. Release the PBT I/II knob after another few more seconds. You should see EE INIT on the LCD. 
§ 
When EE INIT completes, you may see ERR nnn due to initialization. Tap DISP to clear messages. 
§ 
Restore all parameters using the Restore Configuration function of the KX3 Utility program. Then turn 
power off and on again. See if the original problem has been resolved. If not, contact Elecraft.

Error Messages (ERR nnn) 
Error messages may be displayed on VFO B at power-up or during normal operation. In many cases error 
messages are due to a problem with a single option module or incorrect firmware configuration. 
  Some error conditions suggest doing an EEINIT if other remedies fail. DO NOT DO AN EEINIT 
unless:  (1) you have tried re-seating the internal flex cable between the control panel and RF board, then 
powering the unit back on, and (2) you have previously saved your KX3’s configuration file using KX3 Utility. 
Elecraft can provide a copy of your factory configuration file if needed. 
If you see an error message on VFO B (ERR nnn): Write down the error message, as well as any associated 
error data shown on the VFO A display (e.g. d=005). Then tap any switch to clear the error code. Multiple 
errors may occur; in this case, write down each of the messages and VFO A data, if any, before you clear them. 
See Error Message table below for details on specific ERR messages and associated data values, if any.

web site. 
 
RF Board 
The RF PCB (Printed Circuit Board) contains all of the KX3’s RF circuitry as well as low-level baseband (AF) 
stages in the receive path.  The Control Panel (CP) board (following page) generates all digital control signals 
for band switching, T/R, signal path routing, etc.   
The relay-switched low pass filters are used during both transmit and receive. A few of the filters are dedicated 
to one band but most cover two bands.  The signal on the antenna side of the filters pass through a 
forward/reflected power and SWR bridge to the HF-6 meter antenna jack (BNC), or to the optional KXAT3 
automatic antenna tuner.  Latching relays are used to minimize power consumption. 
Transmit/receive (T/R) switching splits the common signal path from the antenna and low pass filters to either 
the transmitter power amp or receiver input.  It also allows sharing the band pass filters between receive and 
transmit.  All T/R switching is done with high-power PIN diodes and CMOS switches to facilitate high speed 
transitions between receive and transmit. 
The synthesized, digitally controlled local oscillator (LO) provides quadrature signals to the transmit and 
receive mixers, as well as a reference signal to the optional KX3-2M/4M module.  The LO has very good phase 
noise performance and can cover a very wide frequency range. Since the KX3 uses a “zero IF” architecture, the 
KX3’s LO frequency is always very close to the operating frequency. 
The RF band-pass filters are used for both transmit and receive. Filters are selected with low-loss CMOS RF 
switches.  The band pass filters significantly attenuate receive signals at harmonics of the RX frequency, 
particularly the odd harmonics. 
Following the band pass filters and T/R switching are two RF preamplifiers and an attenuator.  These provide 
various tradeoffs between RF gain and noise figure (or MDS), as well as local oscillator (LO) isolation.  The 
latter would be useful in situations where another receiver in close proximity could be tuned to the same 
frequency.  A problem inherent in most direct conversion (zero IF) receivers is that some LO energy leaks to the 
antenna and is radiated. This can be a problem when another receiver & antenna is in very close proximity and 
is tuned to the same frequency.  The isolation preamp in the KX3 (RX ISO menu entry) virtually eliminates this 
signal leakage. 
The RX mixer converts the RF signal to quadrature baseband (AF I and Q signals), which are low-pass filtered 
and amplified before being passed to the CP board for analog to digital conversion (ADC).  I and Q baseband 
signals (In-phase and Quadrature) from the mixer are also buffered and sent to the RX I/Q output.  This allows 
attaching the KX3 to a PX3 Panadapter, or to a PC or other device running SDR software (pg. 26). 
The main AF amplifier section also interfaces to the optional KXFL3 filter module that provides narrower 
analog filter bandwidths for improved dynamic range performance with nearby strong interfering signals. 
The TX AF Amp and TX mixer block converts baseband (AF I and Q) modulating signals to an RF signal 
which is then routed to the T/R switching and band pass filters.  This signal provides excitation to the 10W 
power amplifier. The 10W amplifier (PA) uses a pair of RF power MOSFETs.  Temperature monitoring of the

MOSFETS allows automatic reduction of power if they become too hot during long transmit periods at high 
power levels and high ambient temperature. 
The optional KXAT3 automatic antenna tuner (ATU) option connects between the BNC antenna jack and the 
RF board’s SWR/power bridge and low pass filters. It uses a latching relay-switched “L network” with eight 
inductors and eight capacitors capable of matching a wide range of antenna impedances.  The KXAT3 also 
serves as a preselector for operating frequencies below 160 meters, significantly improving reception in the AM 
broadcast band and below. 
Another option, the KXFL3 roofing filter module, provides two additional balanced analog filters in the 
baseband AF I/Q amplifier path. These are much narrower than the default bandwidth. The result is a significant 
performance improvement in rejecting extremely strong interfering signals that are just a few kHz away from 
the received signal. 
Control Panel (CP) Board 
The CP (Control Panel) circuit board contains all of the KX3’s control circuitry as well as high-level baseband 
(AF) stages for the transmit and receive paths.  It contains two on-board microcontrollers: one to manage the 
radio (MCU), and another to process all transmit and receive signals digitally (DSP).  
The DSP is a 32-bit, floating-point device.  All modulation, demodulation, AGC, filtering, equalizing, and other 
signal processing functions are handled by this IC.  
The incoming baseband (audio) signal from the RF board is provided in low-level phase quadrature, or In-phase 
and Quadrature (I/Q). These signals are digitized by a very low power, high-performance analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC), then passed to the DSP for processing. 
The baseband transmit signal is likewise provided in I/Q format to the RF board.  A dedicated, high-
performance digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is used to generate a very clean transmitted signal. 
DSP program storage is by means of a 2 megabyte FLASH memory device.  This IC also provides storage of 
operator messages for the DVR function of the KX3 (pg. 21). 
Stereo (two-channel) audio from the DSP is converted to analog signals for use with headphones or dual 
external speakers (PHONES jack).  The use of stereo allows special processing to help reduce operator fatigue 
(Audio Effects, pg. 20), and also optimizes dual watch capability (pg. 20), where the signals from VFOs A and 
B are routed to the left and right channels. If the internal speaker is used, the audio is monophonic, and is 
boosted by a separate speaker amplifier IC. Microphone audio (or low level audio from a computer or or other 
source) uses another ADC that runs at all times to enable voice-operated transmit (VOX) operation. 
The microcontroller unit (MCU) handles all user interface functions for the KX3, including twenty switches 
and five shaft encoders. It also handles timing, sequencing, and overall management of the entire radio. The 
MCU uses EEPROM (electrically erasable, non-volatile memory) to store operator preferences, message keyer 
(CW/RTTY/PSK) messages, and control settings. A serial port (ACC1) provides an interface between the 
MCU and an attached personal computer (PC), with both RS232 and USB cabling options.  
The MCU uses two industry-standard serial protocols to control circuits on the RF board. I2C (pronounced I-
squared-C) controls the synthesizer.  SPI handles bandswitching, changeover between receive and transmit, etc. 
The driver for the liquid-crystal display (LCD) is also controlled via the I2C port.  
The KXBC3 battery charger is an optional module that plugs into the CP board. It manages charging of NiMH 
AA cells (if applicable). The emphasis on the design is safety, so relatively low charging currents are employed. 
The KXBC3 also incorporates a real-time clock (RTC) function, useful for logging and time keeping. The RTC 
also allows the KX3 to function like a clock radio, turning itself on at a predetermined time (see the ALARM 
menu entry).

Glossary of Selected Terms 
The following terms are often used in the discussion of amateur radio transceivers and related equipment. All 
are directly applicable to the KX3, which is used here to illustrate some of the concepts. A much larger glossary 
of terms can be found in the ARRL Handbook and on numerous web sites. 
________________ 
A-to-D or ADC (analog-to-digital converter): An integrated circuit that converts analog electrical signals such 
as audio or RF into digital form. The digital signals can then be processed by a digital signal processor, or DSP 
(see below). 
AF, RF, and IF: AF stands for audio frequencies—usually, sounds that you can hear. RF, or radio frequencies, 
are the actual frequencies of the radio signals (or TV, or cell phone, etc.). IF, or intermediate frequencies, are 
generally somewhere between RF and AF. In a receiver, it is usually advantageous to convert RF signals to a 
lower IF at which is it more practical to obtain gain or selectivity. These IF signals are then further converted to 
AF and amplified further so they can be used to drive headphones or speakers. 
Attenuator: A circuit that reduces signals to a safe level for use by subsequent stages in a receiver. The KX3 
includes two switchable attenuators, one under control of the user (pg. 13), the other switched in automatically 
as needed (pg. 45, under COR). 
ATU (automatic antenna tuner): A device inserted between a transmitter (or transceiver) and an antenna that 
establishes an optimal match between the two, thus allowing full power transfer. (See KXAT3, pg. 25.) 
D-to-A or DAC (digital-to-analog converter): An integrated circuit that converts digital signals into analog 
form, such as audio or RF. Also see DSP, below. 
dB (decibel): A measure of signal increase or decrease, or of one signal relative to another signal. In human 
terms, one dB represents a “just noticeable difference” between two signals (or a just-noticeable increase or 
decrease). Mathematically, dB is derived from the ratio of two signals. Receivers must handle signals over a 
huge range—in excess of 100 dB. dBm is a more specific term that means “dB relative to 1 milliwatt.” 1 
milliwatt is considered to be a “0 dBm” signal in this case. 
DC-to-DC converter: A device that converts one DC voltage into another. For example, the KX3 includes a 
very efficient DC-to-DC converter that converts 12 V (nominal) at the DC input jack to 3.3 V for use by its low-
voltage circuitry. The advantage of a DC-DC converter is that when it steps voltage down, it steps current up (or 
vice-versa). In this case, the 300 mA the KX3 consumes at 3.3 V might require only 100 mA at the 12-V power 
source.  
DSP (digital signal processor): A highly specialized numeric computer, implemented on a single integrated 
circuit, that processes signals digitally. Inputs to the DSP must generally be converted from analog to digital 
form (see A-to-D, above), while outputs from the DSP must be converted from digital to analog (see D-to-A). 
Use of DSP techniques can result in greater versatility and smaller size compared to the equivalent analog 
circuitry. The KX3 uses a very advanced, power-efficient DSP. 
ESD (electrostatic discharge): An event during which high voltages or currents appear within a radio or other 
electronic device, potentially causing damage. Antennas, control cables, or the operator’s body are all potential 
ESD sources. Damage can be avoided through proper handling and grounding techniques. 
HF (high-frequency): Signals in the range of 3 to 30 MHz. In amateur radio, HF is also shorthand for 160-10 
meters (1.8 to 29.7 MHz), or the “HF bands.” 160 meters actually falls in the MF range (0.3 to 3 MHz). The 6-
meter band (50-54 MHz) is often included in “HF” transceivers, though it is actually in the VHF (very high-
frequency) range of 30-300 MHz. 
IMD (intermodulation distortion): Unwanted signal products that are created in the various stages of a 
receiver or transmitter. If all stages were entirely “clean,” there would be no IMD. In reality, every stage 
contributes some distortion, with the amount of distortion being proportional to signal level. Radio designers go 

============================================================
PAGE 53
============================================================

 
 
 
53 
 
 
to great lengths to minimize distortion, trading off circuit cost and complexity against the benefit of reduced 
interference.  
Keyer: A device that partially automates the sending of Morse code, allowing for faster code speeds. The KX3 
has a built-in keyer function, as well as an optional attached keyer paddle (KXPD3, pg. 25). 
Linear power supply: A power supply that provides a well-regulated DC output voltage using analog regulator 
circuitry. An analog regulator uses continuous voltage feedback, and can be designed to generate virtually no 
noise at radio frequencies, at the expense of power-conversion efficiency. Linear power supplies also typically 
incorporate a transformer and large filter components (capacitors and inductors), resulting in larger and heavier 
packages than switching power supplies (see below).  
MCU (microcontroller unit): A computer or controller usually integrated onto a single integrated circuit. A 
modern amateur transceiver usually has one main MCU that controls most radio functions. It may have other 
smaller MCUs or co-processors that perform specific functions. The KXBC3 option module has its own MCU 
(pg. 25). The DSP in the KX3 is another specialized co-processor (see DSP, above). 
MDS (minimum discernable signal): A measure of a radio’s sensitivity, expressed in dB (decibels) relative to 
1 milliwatt (0 dBm). For example, the user of a KX3 with the 20-dB preamp turned on, can typically copy a CW 
signal at about -137 dBm, or 137 dB below 1 milliwatt. MDS is dependent on the receiver bandwidth, with 500 
Hz normally used for standardized measurements. 
Panadapter:  A special-purpose spectral display that shows signals over a small or large portion of a given 
band. The panadapter samples the transceiver’s I.F. output voltages, then mathematically derives the spectral 
display using a fast-Fourier transform (conversion from time domain to frequency domain). In the case of the 
Elecraft PX3, a 2 kHz to 200 kHz range can be displayed, with both a spectral plot and a “waterfall,” which 
shows the history of signals over several seconds’ time. 
Preamp: A pre-amplifier that increases RF signals to a higher level for use by subsequent stages in a receiver. 
A preamp is generally designed to contribute little noise of its own, so that it improves the noise figure of the 
radio (also see MDS). The KX3 includes two different preamps for use in different situations (pg. 13). 
Roofing filter: A filter built with analog components that rejects some out-of-band signals which could cause 
overload or distortion. The roofing filter appears ahead of the A-to-D converter and DSP in a receiver’s signal 
chain, protecting them to some degree. The KX3 has an optional dual roofing filter (see KXFL3, pg. 25.) 
SDR (software-defined radio): A radio that performs signal modulation, demodulation, filtering, and other 
functions in software. The software might execute internally in a dedicated DSP IC, as in the Elecraft K3 or 
KX3, or externally in a general-purpose computer  (pg. 26).  
Switching power supply: A power supply that provides a regulated DC output voltage by rapidly injecting 
current pulses into its load. The duration of the pulses varies with the required load current at any given instant. 
The switching rates used in this type of regulator can be in the hundreds of kHz or even MHz, and their period 
can vary widely. This is why such power supplies often generate RFI (radio-frequency interference) or hash if 
not well-shielded and filtered. Switching supplies are typically much smaller than linear supplies (see above) for 
a given output current, and are used in most PCs and other electronic equipment because of the reduced 
manufacturing cost. However, much of the RFI heard in amateur receivers originates from switching supplies in 
nearby gear or even from neighboring houses. The supply that powers the radio itself is especially critical, and a 
linear supply will often provide better results. 
VFO (variable frequency oscillator): A signal source used to select a radio’s operating frequency. The KX3’s 
large knob controls VFO A, while a smaller knob controls VFO B (see Using VFOs A and B, pg. 11).

Customer Service and Support 
Technical Assistance 
You can send e-mail to KX3support@elecraft.com and we will respond quickly – typically the same day 
Monday through Friday. If you need replacement parts, send an e-mail to parts@elecraft.com. Telephone 
assistance is available from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Pacific time (weekdays only) at 831-763-4211. Please use e-mail 
rather than calling when possible since this gives us a written record of the details of your problem and allows us 
to handle a larger number of requests each day.  
Repair / Alignment Service 
If necessary, you may return your Elecraft product to us for repair or alignment. (Note: We offer unlimited email 
and phone support, so please try that route first as we can usually help you find the problem quickly.)  
 
IMPORTANT: (1) REMOVE BATTERIES before shipping. (2) You must contact Elecraft before mailing 
your product to obtain authorization for the return, what address to ship it to and current information on repair 
fees and turn around times. (Frequently we can determine the cause of your problem and save you the trouble of 
shipping it back to us.) Our repair location is different from our factory location in Aptos. We will give you the 
address to ship your kit to at the time of repair authorization. Packages shipped to Aptos without authorization 
will incur an additional shipping charge for reshipment from Aptos to our repair depot. 
 
Elecraft 1-Year Limited Warranty 
 
This warranty is effective as of the date of first consumer purchase (or if shipped from the factory, the date the 
product is shipped to the customer). It covers both our kits and fully assembled products. For kits, before requesting 
warranty service, you should fully complete the assembly, carefully following all instructions in the manual. 
 
Who is covered:  This warranty covers the original owner of the Elecraft product as disclosed to Elecraft at the time 
of order. Elecraft products transferred by the purchaser to a third party, either by sale, gift, or other method, who is 
not disclosed to Elecraft at the time of original order, are not covered by this warranty. If the Elecraft product is being 
bought indirectly for a third party, the third party’s name and address must be provided at time of order to ensure 
warranty coverage. 
 
What is covered:  During the first year after date of purchase, Elecraft will replace defective or missing parts free of 
charge (post-paid). We will also correct any malfunction to kits or assembled units caused by defective parts and 
materials. Purchaser pays inbound shipping to us for warranty repair; we pay shipping to return the repaired 
equipment to you by UPS ground service or equivalent to the continental USA and Canada. For Alaska, Hawaii, and 
other destinations outside the U.S. and Canada, actual return shipping cost is paid by the owner. 
 
What is not covered: This warranty does not cover correction of kit assembly errors. It also does not cover 
misalignment; repair of damage caused by misuse, negligence, battery leakage or corrosion, or builder modifications; 
or any performance malfunctions involving non-Elecraft accessory equipment. The use of acid-core solder, water-
soluble flux solder, or any corrosive or conductive flux or solvent will void this warranty in its entirety. Also not 
covered is reimbursement for loss of use, inconvenience, customer assembly or alignment time, or cost of 
unauthorized service. 
 
Limitation of incidental or consequential damages: This warranty does not extend to non-Elecraft equipment or 
components used in conjunction with our products. Any such repair or replacement is the responsibility of the 
customer. Elecraft will not be liable for any special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, including but not 
limited to any loss of business or profits.
