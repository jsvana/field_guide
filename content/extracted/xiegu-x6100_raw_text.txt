Operation methods:
1. Select any filter from FILTER1~3 to enter.
2. Short press the MFK knob to switch and select different edge-cut filters. The blue trapezoidal box is the high-cut filter
(H-CUT), and the red trapezoidal box is the low-cut filter (L-CUT).
3. Rotate the MFK knob to adjust the parameters of the filter according to the actual use. After adjustment, the current filter
parameters will be automatically stored in the corresponding filter label.
4. Short press [DEFAULT] to restore the filter parameters selected currently to the default parameters.
5. Short press [CLOSE] to exit the current interface.
6. As shown in the figure above, the start frequency and cut-off frequency of the filter can be adjusted respectively to set the
filter. The overlapping region of the two schematic trapezoidal filter graphs is the actual action range of the filter. The
details are as follows:
Filter composition diagram:
As shown in the figure on the right, the
filter
is
acted
by
L-CUT
and
H-CUT
together
to
form
an
effective
filter
bandwidth.
L-CUT controls the low boundary frequency
and can effectively cut off the low frequency
component;
H-CUT
controls
the
high
boundary
frequency and can effectively cut off the
high frequency component;
In daily use, it can be adjusted according to
own habits to achieve the best listening
effect.
*Note: If the actual bandwidth of the filter is
smaller than that of the useful signal, the
useful signal will be completely cut off,
resulting in no signal to be heard.

Appendix 1
Connection between X6100 and XPA125B (L4001 cable)
After the X6100 connects with XPA125B power amplifier and antenna tuner AIO through the L4001 cables,
the output power can be expanded to 100W.
After connection, the X6100 can automatically control the wave band switching of XPA125B. Moreover, the
ALC control will be built between two machines. When the X6100 output power exceeds the power limit of
the XPA125B, the AACL control will automatically decrease the output power of the radio so that the output
power of the XPA125B will be kept to be about 100W.
We suggest to set the output power of the X6100 to be ≤2.5W to protect the amplifier equipment.
■
XPA125B power amplifier and L4001 cable need to be separately ordered.

2. The CH342 port driver needs to be installed.
3. Select the model "XIEGU X108G" on the data communication software (or Control Software) side to
complete the connection.
4. Select the virtual sound card option through the control software to get sound input and output.
Note: If choose other rig that be compatible with CIV instructions, there may be incompatibility.
Connect with N1MM to automatically transmit CW
The connection method is the same as above, and the port is also connected to the DEV port on the right side
of the X6100. After configuring the settings of the N1MM terminal, the PC can be used to control the X6100
to send CW telegrams.
External mouse 、keyboard equipment
Connect the mouse, keyboard or other external input devices to the HOST interface on the right side of the
X6100, and then you can operate the X6100 by the external mouse or keyboard.
