1. Introduction
The Elecraft K2 is a high-performance, synthesized, CW/SSB 
transceiver that covers all HF bands. It is a true dual-purpose 
transceiver, combining the operating features you’d expect in a 
home-station rig with the small size and weight of a rugged,  
go-anywhere portable.  
 
The basic K2 operates on 80-10 meter CW, and provides over 10 
watts of RF output. If you prefer a full-power station, you can 
complete your K2 as a K2/100 at any time by adding the internal 
100-watt final stage (KPA100 option). Assembly of the KPA100 is 
covered in Appendix G, a separate manual supplied with the 
KPA100 kit. 
 
You can customize your K2 by choosing from a wide range of 
additional options: 
 
 
SSB adapter with optimized 7-pole crystal filter 
 
Automatic antenna tuner (20 W internal or 150 W external)  
 
160-m adapter with receive antenna switch 
 
60-m adapter with low-level transverter interface 
 
Computer control interface (RS232) 
 
Noise blanker 
 
Digital or analog audio filter, each with real-time clock 
 
Internal 2.9-Ah rechargeable battery 
 
Programmable band decoder 
 
High-Performance VHF and UHF transverters 
 
For a complete description of available options, see page 117. In 
addition to the options, a companion enclosure the same size and 
style as the K2 is available for those who wish to build their own 
matching station accessories (model EC2). 
The K2 is an intermediate-level kit, yet you’ll be pleasantly surprised at 
how uncomplicated it is to build. All of the RF (radio-frequency) 
circuitry is contained on a single board, while two plug-in modules 
provide front panel and control functions. Wiring is minimal, unlike 
traditional kits which depend on complex wiring harnesses.  
 
A unique feature of the K2 is that it provides its own built-in test 
equipment, including a digital voltmeter, ammeter, wattmeter, complete 
RF probe, and frequency counter. These circuits are completed early in 
assembly, so they're ready to be used when you begin construction and 
alignment of the RF board. We also provide complete troubleshooting 
and signal-tracing information. 
 
In addition to this owner’s manual, you’ll find extensive support for the 
K2 on our website, www.elecraft.com. Among the available materials 
are manual updates, application notes, photographs, and information on 
new products. There’s also an e-mail forum; sign-up is available from 
the web page. It’s a great way to seek advice from the K2’s designers 
and your fellow builders, or to tell us about your first QSO using the K2. 
 
We’d like to thank you for choosing the K2 transceiver, and hope it 
meets your expectations for operation both at home and in the field.

Pre-Wound Toroids Available 
 
You can obtain a set of pre-wound toroids for the K2 if you prefer not to 
wind them yourself. Refer to our web site for details.

Customer Service Information 
 
Technical Assistance 
 
You can send e-mail to support@elecraft.com and we will respond 
quickly - typically the same day Monday through Friday. Telephone 
assistance is available from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Pacific time (weekdays 
only) at 831-763-4211. Please use e-mail rather than calling when 
possible since this gives us a written record of the details of your 
problem and allows us to handle a larger number of requests each 
day. 
Repair / Alignment Service (We want to make sure 
everyone succeeds!) 
If necessary, you may return your Elecraft product to us for repair or 
alignment. (Note: We offer unlimited email and phone support to get 
your kit running, so please try that route first as we can usually help 
you find the problem quickly.)  
IMPORTANT: You must contact Elecraft before mailing your 
product to obtain authorization for the return, what address to ship it 
to and current information on repair fees and turnaround times. 
(Frequently we can determine the cause of your problem and save 
you the trouble of shipping it back to us.) Our repair location is 
different from our factory location in Aptos. We will give you the 
address to ship your kit to at the time of repair authorization. 
Packages shipped to Aptos without authorization will incur an 
additional shipping charge for reshipment from Aptos to our repair 
depot. 
To ship the unit, first seal it in a plastic bag to protect the finish. Use 
a sturdy packing carton with at least 3-in (8 cm) of foam or shredded 
paper on all sides. Seal the package with reinforced tape. (Neither 
Elecraft or the carrier will accept liability for damage due to 
improper packaging.)  
 
 
Elecraft 1-Year Limited Warranty 
 
This warranty is effective as of the date of first consumer purchase (or if 
shipped from the factory, the date the product is shipped to the customer). It 
covers both our kits and fully assembled products. For kits, before requesting 
warranty service, you should fully complete the assembly, carefully 
following all instructions in the manual. 
 
Who is covered:  This warranty covers the original owner of the Elecraft 
product as disclosed to Elecraft at the time of order. Elecraft products 
transferred by the purchaser to a third party, either by sale, gift, or other 
method, who is not disclosed to Elecraft at the time of original order, are not 
covered by this warranty. If the Elecraft product is being bought indirectly 
for a third party, the third party’s name and address must be provided at time 
of order to ensure warranty coverage. 
 
What is covered:  During the first year after date of purchase, Elecraft will 
replace defective or missing parts free of charge (post-paid). We will also 
correct any malfunction to kits or assembled units caused by defective parts 
and materials. Purchaser pays inbound shipping to us for warranty repair; we 
pay shipping to return the repaired equipment to you by UPS ground service 
or equivalent to the continental USA and Canada. For Alaska, Hawaii, and 
other destinations outside the U.S. and Canada, actual return shipping cost is 
paid by the owner. 
 
What is not covered: This warranty does not cover correction of kit 
assembly errors. It also does not cover misalignment; repair of damage 
caused by misuse, negligence, battery leakage or corrosion, or builder 
modifications; or any performance malfunctions involving non-Elecraft 
accessory equipment. The use of acid-core solder, water-soluble flux solder, 
or any corrosive or conductive flux or solvent will void this warranty in its 
entirety. Also not covered is reimbursement for loss of use, inconvenience, 
customer assembly or alignment time, or cost of unauthorized service. 
 
Limitation of incidental or consequential damages: This warranty does 
not extend to non-Elecraft equipment or components used in conjunction 
with our products. Any such repair or replacement is the responsibility of the 
customer. Elecraft will not be liable for any special, indirect, incidental or

3. Preparation for Assembly
Overview of the Kit 
 
The K2 uses modular construction, both physically and electrically. 
This concept extends to the chassis (Figure 3-1). Any chassis element 
can be removed during assembly or troubleshooting. (Also see photos 
in Appendix D.) If the KPA100 is installed, it takes the place of the 
original top cover.

As shown in Figure 3-2, there are three printed circuit boards (PCBs) 
in the basic K2 kit:  the Front Panel board, Control Board, and RF 
board. Option modules plug into the RF or Control board, but are not 
shown here.

    ELECRAFT® 
Board-to-board Connectors 
 
The circuit boards in the K2 are interconnected using board-to-board 
connectors, which eliminates nearly all hand wiring. Gold-plated 
contacts are used on these connectors for reliability and corrosion 
resistance.  
 
Figure 3-3 shows a side view of the PC boards and board-to-board 
connectors. As can be seen in the drawing, the Front Panel board has a 
connector J1 which mates with right-angle connector P1 on the RF 
board. Similarly, right-angle connector P1 on the Control Board mates 
with J6 on the RF board. (Not shown in this drawing are two 
additional right-angle connectors on the Control board, P2 and P3, 
which mate with J7 and J8 on the RF board.) 
 
These multi-pin connectors are very difficult to remove once 
soldered in place. Refer to Figure 3-3 during assembly to make 
sure you have each connector placed correctly before soldering.

There are six steps in the K2 assembly process: 
 
1. Control Board assembly 
2. Front Panel Board assembly 
3. RF Board assembly and test, part I (control circuits) 
4. RF Board assembly and test, part II (receiver and synthesizer) 
5. RF Board assembly and test, part III (transmitter) 
6. Final assembly 
 
This assembly sequence is important because later steps build on the 
previous ones. For example, in step 3 you’ll put the modules together 
for the first time, allowing you to try out the K2’s built-in frequency 
counter. The counter will then be used in step 4 to align and test the 
receiver and synthesizer on 40 meters. In step 5 all the pieces will 
come together when you complete the transmitter and filters, then 
align the K2 on all bands. The last few details—speaker, tilt stand, 
etc.—will be wrapped up in step 6. 
  
Unpacking and Inventory 
 
When you open the kit you should find the following items:   
 
 
six chassis pieces (Figure 3-1) 
 
three printed circuit boards (Figure 3-2) 
 
FRONT PANEL board components bag 
 
CONTROL board components bag 
 
RF board components in two bags 
 
MISCELLANEOUS components bag (includes hardware) 
 
WIRE bag 
 
4-ohm Speaker, 5 small knobs, and large tuning knob 
 
plastic tube containing the latching relays 
 
an envelope containing the LCD bezel, green LED bargraph filter, 
serial number label, thermal insulators, and other items  
Inventory  
  
We strongly recommend that you do an inventory of parts before 
beginning to assemble the kit. It is not necessary to inventory the 
resistors, which are supplied attached to tape in assembly order. 
 
Even if you don’t do an inventory, it is helpful to familiarize yourself 
with the parts list, Appendix A. Additional information on identifying 
capacitor, chokes, and resistors is provided below. 
 
Identifying Capacitors 
 
Small-value fixed capacitors are usually marked with one, two, or 
three digits and no decimal point. If one or two digits are used, that is 
always the value in picofarads (pF). If there are three digits, the third 
digit is a multiplier. For example, a capacitor marked "151" would be 
150 pF (15 with a multiplier of 101). Similarly, "330" would be 33 pF, 
and "102" would be 1000 pF (or .001 µF). In rare cases a capacitor 
manufacturer may use "0" as a decimal placeholder. For example, 
"820" might mean 820 pF rather than the usual 82 pF. Such exceptions 
are usually covered in the parts lists. To be safe, measure the values of 
all capacitors below 1000 pF (most DMMs include capacitance 
measurement capability). 
 
Fixed capacitors with values of 1000 pF or higher generally use a 
decimal point in the value, such as .001 or .02. This is the value in 
microfarads (µF). Capacitors also may have a suffix after the value, 
such as ".001J."  In some cases the suffixes or other supplemental 
markings may be useful in identifying capacitors. 
 
Hard-to-identify capacitor values: 
 
3.3 pF: These capacitors may have pillow-shaped, dark-green bodies 
about 1/8" (3 mm) square, with a black mark on the top. The "3.3"  
label may be difficult to read without a magnifying glass. 
 
150 pF: These are correctly marked "151" on one side, but the other 
side may be marked #21 ASD, where "#21" looks like "821."

Resistors, Chokes, and the Color Code 
 
All resistor and RF choke color bands are provided in the text along 
with their values. However, it is helpful to familiarize yourself with 
the color code to allow you to identify these components without 
having to refer to the text or parts list each time. 
 
The color-code chart, Figure 3-4, shows how to read the four color 
bands on 5% resistors. 1% resistors are similar, except that they use 
five bands (three significant digits, multiplier, and tolerance). For 
example, a 1,500 ohm (1.5 k) 5% resistor has color bands BROWN, 
GREEN, and RED. A 1.5 k, 1% resistor has color bands BROWN, 
GREEN, BLACK, BROWN. The multiplier value is 1 rather than 2 in 
the 1% case because of the third significant digit. 
 
Because 1% resistors have color bands that are sometimes hard to 
distinguish clearly, you should always check their resistance using an 
ohmmeter. 
 
The markings on RF chokes reflect their value in microhenries (µH). 
Like 5% resistors, chokes use two significant digits and a multiplier. 
Example:  an RF choke with color bands RED, VIOLET, BLACK 
would have a value of 27 µH.

about assembly, alignment, or operation of the K2.  
 
Photographs 
 
You should review the photographs in Appendix D to get an idea of 
what the completed PC board assemblies look like.  
 
Step-by-Step Assembly 
 
Each step in the assembly process is accompanied by a check-box: 
 
In some steps you will actually be installing multiple components of a 
particular type. In this case the instructions will be followed by a table 
listing all of the components to be installed, so you won’t need to refer 
to the parts list during assembly. The order that the components are 
installed corresponds to their PCB locations.  
 
Do not skip any assembly steps; you may find that you’ve installed 
one component that hinders the installation of another.  
 
Forming component leads: In a few cases you’ll find that the space 
provided for a component on the PC board is larger than the distance 
between the leads on the part itself. In such cases, you’ll need to 
carefully bend the leads out and then down to fit the given space. 
Always use needle-nose pliers to accomplish this task, and bend the 
leads–don’t tug on them. This is especially important with capacitor 
leads, which are fragile.  
 
Bottom-Mounted Components 
 
A number of components in the K2 are mounted on the bottom of the 
PC boards to improve component spacing or for electrical reasons. 
Component outline symbols are provided on both sides of each board, 
so it will always be clear which side a particular component goes on. 
You’ll be able to tell the top of the board from the bottom easily:  the 
top side has far more parts. Bottom-mounted parts are identified on the 
schematic by this symbol: 
 
 
 
 
Top/bottom interference: In a few cases, top-mounted parts may 
interfere with the trimming and soldering of a bottom-mounted part. In 
this case, pre-trim the leads of the bottom-mounted part before final 
placement, and solder it on the bottom rather than on the top. (Since all 
holes are plated-through, you can solder on either side.)

Integrated Circuits and ESD 
 
The K2 transceiver uses integrated circuits and transistors that can be 
damaged by electrostatic discharge (ESD). Problems caused by ESD 
can often be difficult to troubleshoot because components may only be 
degraded, at first, rather than fail completely.  
 
To avoid such problems, simply touch an unpainted, grounded metal 
surface before handling any components, and occasionally as you 
build. We also recommend that you take the following anti-static 
precautions (in order of importance): 
 
 
Leave ESD-sensitive parts in their anti-static packaging until you 
install them 
 
Ground yourself using a wrist strap with a series 1 megohm 
resistor (do NOT ground yourself directly, as this poses a shock 
hazard) 
 
Make sure your soldering iron has a grounded tip 
 
Use an anti-static mat on your work bench 
 
IC Sockets 
 
Sockets are used for only the largest ICs. You should not use sockets 
for the other ICs because they tend to be unreliable and can cause 
problems due to added lead length. Since sockets are not used in most 
cases, you must double-check the part number and orientation of each 
IC before soldering. 
 
Soldering, Desoldering, and Plated-Through Holes 
 
CAUTION: Solder contains lead, and its residue can be toxic. 
Always wash your hands after handling solder. 
 
The printed circuit boards used in the K2 have circuitry on both sides 
("double-sided"). Boards of this type require plated-through holes to 
complete electrical connections between the two sides. 
 
 
When you solder components on these boards, the solder fills the 
plated holes, making excellent contact. This means that you do not 
need to leave a large "fillet" or build-up of solder on top of the pads 
themselves. A small amount of solder will do for all connections. 
 
Unfortunately, removing components from double-sided PC boards 
can be difficult, since you must get all of the solder back out of the 
hole before a lead can be removed. To do this, you'll need solder wick 
and a vacuum desoldering tool (see techniques below). 
 
The best strategy for avoiding de-soldering is to place all components 
properly the first time. Double-check values and orientations, and 
avoid damaging parts via ESD. 
 
When removing components: 
 
 
Don't pull a lead or pin out of a hole unless the solder has been 
removed, or you are applying heat. Otherwise, you can literally 
pull out the plating on the plated-through hole. 
 
Limit soldering iron contact to a few seconds at a time. 
 
Use small-size solder-wick, about 0.1" or 2.5 mm wide. Use the 
wick on both the top and bottom pads when possible. This helps 
get all of the solder out of the hole. 
 
Buy and learn how to use a large hand-operated vacuum 
desoldering tool, such as the "Soldapullt," model DS017LS. Small 
solder suckers are not effective. 
 
With ICs and connectors, clip all of the pins at the body first, then 
remove all of the pins slowly, one at a time. You may damage 
pads and traces by trying to remove a component intact, possibly 
leaving a PC board very difficult to repair. 
 
Invest in a PC board vice with a heavy base if possible. This 
makes parts removal easier because it frees up both hands. 
 
If in doubt about a particular repair, ask for advice from Elecraft 
or from a someone else with PCB repair experience. Our e-mail 
reflector is also an excellent source for help.

4. Control Board 
The Control board is the "brain" of the K2. It monitors all signals 
during receive and transmit, and handles display and control functions 
via the Front Panel board. The microcontroller, analog and digital 
control circuits, automatic gain control (AGC), and audio amplifier are 
located on this board.  
 
Components 
i
   Review the precautions described in the previous section 
before handling any IC’s or transistors. These components can be 
damaged by static discharge, and the resulting problems are often 
difficult to troubleshoot. 
 Open the bag of components labeled CONTROL and sort the 
parts into groups (resistors, diodes, capacitors, etc.). If any of the 
components are unfamiliar, identify them using the illustrations in the 
parts list, Appendix A. 
 Locate the Control board. It is the smallest of the three K2 PC 
boards, labeled "K2 CONTROL" on the front side, in the lower right-
hand corner. The lower left-hand corner is notched. 
 Open the bag labeled MISCELLANEOUS and empty the 
contents into a shallow box or pan. This will prevent loss of any of the 
small hardware while allowing you to locate items as needed. 
i
  The Allen wrenches are located in a small bag with the  
MISCELLANEOUS items. These wrenches may have been oiled 
during manufacturing. Remove the wrenches and wipe off the oil, if 
any, then discard the bag. 
i
   There are five sizes of 4-40 machine screws provided with the 
kit. The relative sizes of the screws are shown below for identification 
purposes (not to scale). All of the screws are black anodized except for 
the 7/16" (11 mm) screws. The 3/16" (4.8 mm) pan-head screws are 
the most numerous, and will be referred to as chassis screws 
throughout the manual. There is only one flat-head, 3/16" screw. 
 
Flat-head, 3/16”  (4.8 mm)
Pan-head, 3/16”  (4.8 mm)
(chassis screws) 
Pan-head, 3/8”  (9.5 mm) 
Pan-head, 1/2” (12.7 mm) 
Pan-head, 7/16” (11 mm) 
 
Identify all of the 4-40 screws and sort them into groups.

Assembly 
 
 The side of the Control board with most of the components is the 
top side. With the top side of the Control board facing you and the 
notch at the lower left, locate the position of resistor R5, near the left 
edge. The label "R5" appears just below the resistor’s outline. 
 Install a 33-k resistor (orange-orange-orange) at R5, with the 
orange bands at the top and the gold band (indicating 5% tolerance) at 
the bottom. Make sure it is seated flush with the board, then bend the 
leads on the bottom to hold it in place. Do not solder this resistor until 
the remaining fixed resistors have been installed in the next step. 
 Install the remaining fixed resistors, which are listed below in 
left-to-right PC board order. The resistors should all be oriented with 
their first significant-digit band toward the left or top. This will make 
the color codes easier to read if you need to re-check the values after 
installation. Check 1% resistors with an ohmmeter. 
 
Note:  When multiple items appear on one line in a component list 
such as the one below, complete all items on one line before moving 
on to the next, as indicated by the small arrow. (In other words, install 
R5 first, then R2, then go to the second line.) 
 
__ R5, 33 k (ORG-ORG-ORG)   __ R2, 3.3 M (ORG-ORG-GRN) 
 
__ R3, 10 k (BRN-BLK-ORG) 
__ R4, 5.6 k (GRN-BLU-RED) 
__ R6, 100 (BRN-BLK-BRN) 
 
__ R7, 1.78 k, 1% (BRN-VIO-GRY-BRN) 
__ R8, 100, 1% (BRN-BLK-BLK-BLK) 
__ R9, 806 k, 1% (GRY-BLK-BLU-ORG) 
__ R10, 196 k, 1% (BRN-WHT-BLU-ORG) 
 
__ R16, 10 (BRN-BLK-BLK)   __ R17, 3.3 M (ORG-ORG-GRN)  
__ R21, 270 k (RED-VIO-YEL) 
__ R20, 2.7 ohms (RED-VIO-GLD) 
 
 Solder all of the resistors, then trim the leads as close as possible 
to the solder joints. Some builders prefer to trim the leads before 
soldering. Either method can be used. 
Note: Save clipped leads from 1/4-watt resistors that are at least 1/2” 
(13 mm) long. You’ll need several of them for ground test points and 
other uses later on.  
 Locate RP6, a 5.1 k, 10-pin resistor network. ("RP" means 
"resistor pack," another name for resistor networks.) RP6 is usually 
labeled "770103512." Check the parts list for alternative resistor 
network labels if necessary. Pin 1 of RP6 is indicated by a dot.  
 Locate the component outline for RP6 at the left end of the PC 
board. Install the resistor network so that the end with the dot is lined 
up with the "1" label. 
 Make sure the resistor network is seated firmly on the board, then 
bend the leads at the far ends in opposite directions to hold it in place. 
(Do not trim the leads.)  Do not solder RP6 yet.  
i
  Components with many leads are difficult to remove once 
soldered. Double-check the part numbers and orientation. 
 Install the remaining resistor networks in the order listed below. 
Do not solder them until the next step. 
 
__ RP1, 3.9 k, 10 pins (770103392)    __ RP7, 33 k, 8 pins (8A3.333G) 
__ RP2, 82 k, 8 pins (77083823)  
    __ RP3, 47 k, 10 pins (10A3.473G) 
__ RP5, 470, 10 pins (10A3.471G)     __ RP4, 82 k, 8 pins (77083823) 
 Solder the resistor networks. (No need to trim the leads.) 
 Install potentiometer R1 (50 k), located at the left side of the 
board. R1 will sit above the board due to the shoulders on its pins. 
Hold it in place (flat, not tilted) while soldering.

 Install the 82 mH shielded inductor (L1) as shown by its 
component outline. Make sure the L1 is pressed down onto the PC 
board as far as it can go, then bend the leads slightly to hold it in place 
while soldering. 
 Install the 1N4148 diodes listed below. D1 is in the upper left-
hand corner of the PC board. If a diode has only one band, the end 
with the band (the cathode) should be oriented toward the banded end 
of the corresponding PC board outline. If a diode has multiple bands, 
the widest band indicates the cathode end. 
 
__ D1, 1N4148  
__ D2, 1N4148  
 Double-check the orientation of the diodes, then solder. 
 Find the component outline for diode D3, near the top edge of the 
board (right end). Install and solder resistor R22 at this location (82 k, 
gray-red-orange). 
 Install the small fixed capacitors listed below, beginning with C2 
in the upper left-hand corner of the board. (This list includes all of the 
fixed capacitors on the Control board except the tall, cylindrical 
electrolytic types, which will be installed later.)  The list shows both 
the value and the capacitor labels, using notation explained in the 
previous section. After installing each capacitor, bend the leads 
outward to hold it in place, but do not solder. 
 
Note:  Remember to complete all items in each line before moving on 
to the next. (Install C2, C3, and C4, then C7, etc.)

 Prepare two 3/4" (19 mm) jumpers wires from discarded 
component leads. These short jumpers will be used to ground the 
crystal cans in the next step. 
i
  Grounding the crystal cans in the following step is required to 
ensure proper crystal oscillator performance. 
Referring to Figure 4-3, insert the jumper wires into the grounding 
holes provided near X1 and X2. Fold each wire over the top of the 
crystal and solder it to the top of the can. (Only a small amount of 
solder is required.) Then solder and trim the wire on the bottom of the

they are soldered. Follow all instructions carefully. 
 Hold the Control board vertically as shown in the side view 
below (Figure 4-7). The top side of the board--the side with most of 
the components--should be to the right. 
 Turn to page 8 and review Figure 3-3, which shows how the 
Control board plugs into the RF board. P1, P2, and P3 will all be 
installed on the top side of the Control board as shown. 
 Position 6-pin right-angle connector P1 as shown in the side view 
below (Figure 4-7). Do not solder P1 until the next step. The plastic 
part of the connector must be seated flat against the PC board, and the 
pins must be parallel to the board. Do not bend or trim the pins on the

  When you install ICs in the following steps, always straighten 
the leads of each IC first as shown in Figure 4-9. The two rows of pins 
must be straight and parallel to each other to establish the proper pin 
spacing for insertion into the PC board or socket.  
 
To straighten the pins, rest one entire row of pins against a hard, flat

  Before handling any IC, touch an unpainted, grounded 
metal surface or put on a conductive wrist-strap. 
Locate U2, an 8-pin IC, part number LM833. (LM833 is the basic 
part number. There may be an additional prefix or suffix or other 
markings.) This and all remaining ICs on the Control board are Dual-
Inline Packages, or DIPs. Referring to Figure 4-10, identify the 
notched or dimpled end of the IC. IC pins are counted starting from 
pin 1 (as shown below) and going counter-clockwise.

Figure 4-10 
Straighten the leads of U2 (see Figure 4-9).  
Install U2 in the orientation shown by its PC board outline, near 
the upper left-hand corner of the PC board, but do not solder it yet. 
Make sure the notched or dimpled end is lined up with the notched end 
of the PC board outline. Even though the outline is covered when the 
IC is installed, you can still verify that the IC is installed correctly by 
looking at pin 1. The PC board pad corresponding to pin 1 will be 
either oval or round.  
i
  You may overheat the IC pins or PC pads if you take an 
excessive length of time to solder. After a few tries, you should be able 
to solder an IC pin in about 1 or 2 seconds.  
 Bend two of U2’s corner pins out slightly on the bottom of the 
board to hold the IC firmly in place, flat against the top of the board. 
Find pin 1 and verify that its pad is either round or oval. Once U2 is 
properly seated, solder all eight pins, using a minimum of solder. 
Install the ICs listed below. Bend the pins to hold each IC in place 
as you did with U2, but do not solder until the next step. The notched 
or dimpled end of each IC must be aligned with the notched end of its 
PC board outline. 
 
Note: For U1, the IC type supplied may be either NE602 or SA602.  
  
__ U1, NE602 
 
__ U3, LM6482  
__ U7, 25LC320 
__ U8, MAX534  
__ U9, LM380 
 
__ U10, LMC660 
Check the orientation of pin 1 on each IC by looking at the 
associated PC board pads, as before. Then solder all of the ICs. 
Locate the microcontroller, U6.  
Straighten the pins of U6 (see Figure 4-9). With a large IC such as 
this, you can hold the IC body at both ends as you re-form each row of 
pins. 
i
  When the microcontroller is pressed in its socket, you must be 
careful to avoid jamming its pins. Make sure that all pins are lined up 
with the associated holes in the socket before pressing down on the IC. 
Watch the pins on both rows as you press down, re-aligning them with 
the socket holes individually if necessary. 
Insert the microcontroller, U6, into its socket. Make sure that  
pin 1 on the IC itself is lined up with the pin 1 label near the lower 
left-hand corner of the PCB outline. Note: The revision label on the  
IC (usually white) may not be oriented the same direction as the text 
printed on the IC. Do not use the label as a guide--use the notch or 
dimple to identify pin 1.

Key Shaping Components (Required) 
 
Your K2 kit includes recent changes that provide an optimized keying  envelope shape (sigmoidal, or S-shaped leading and trailing edges). 
The result is completely click-free CW transmission. Two of the parts for this change must be installed on the back of the Control board as 
described below. 
 Locate the green insulated hookup wire. Strip two 1/4" (6.4 mm) lengths of insulation from one end of the wire. These will be used to insulate 
the leads of C46 in the following steps. 
 Slip the two lengths of insulation over the leads of a .01 µf capacitor ("103"). This is a new component (C46), not present on the board. 
i
  Figure 4-11, below, shows the bottom side of the Control board. Components shown with dotted outlines are located on the top side.  
 On the bottom  side of the Control board, solder C46 between R21 and the base lead of Q8 as shown below. Keep lead length short. 
 
           
Figure 4-11
 
 A 22 µF electrolytic capacitor has also been added (C45). Solder C45 as indicated above, between U8 pin 2 (+ lead) and U8 pin 14 (- lead). 
 Carefully compare your installation of C46 and C45 to Figure 4-11. Make sure the leads of these capacitors are soldered to the indicated pads. 
Verify the orientation of the (+) and (-) leads on C45.

Option Components 
 
All component locations on the Control board should now be filled 
except for the following: 
 
 
C44 (top side of the board near the microcontroller, U6). This 
capacitor will not be used. 
 
J1 and J2 (bottom side).  These two connectors are provided for an 
audio filter option (KAF2 or KDSP2). An audio filter should not 
be installed until the K2 has been completed and tested. 
 
Visual Inspection 
 
Nearly all problems with kits are due to incorrectly installed 
components or poor solder joints. You can avoid these problems by 
doing a simple visual inspection. A few minutes spent here may save 
you hours of troubleshooting time. 
Make sure there are no components installed backwards. Check 
all diodes, resistor networks, electrolytic capacitors, and ICs. (The 
parts placement drawings in Appendix F will be helpful when 
checking diode orientation.)  
Examine the bottom of the PC board carefully for the following 
(use a magnifying glass if available): 
 
 
cold solder joints 
 
solder bridges 
 
unsoldered pins 
 
  
Resistance Checks 
 
In the table below, "<" means "less than," and ">" means "greater 
than." When measuring resistances that show a minimum value in the 
table (such as > 100 k), your resistance reading may be much higher or 
even infinite. This is typical when using a DMM (digital multimeter). 
If you use an analog meter you may find that some or all resistance 
measurements are too low. Note: Some digital multimeters will flash 
their display to indicate an infinite resistance. 
 Perform the resistance checks listed below to ensure that there are 
no shorts in the most critical control circuits. (The Control board will 
be fully tested in a later section.)

5. Front Panel Board 
The Front Panel board includes all of the control and display devices 
that you’ll use when operating the K2, including the liquid-crystal 
display (LCD), LED bargraph, push-button switches, and 
potentiometers. See Appendix D for photos of the completed front 
panel assembly. 
  
Components 
 Open the bag labeled FRONT PANEL and sort the parts into 
groups (resistors, diodes, capacitors, etc.). Observe anti-static 
precautions when handling ICs and transistors. 
 Locate the front panel PC board, which is just a bit larger than the 
Control board. It is labeled "K2 FP" on the top side, in the lower right-
hand corner. 
 
Assembly 
i
  Your K2’s appearance and operation will be adversely 
affected if the controls or display are not mounted correctly, and in the 
indicated sequence. There are also special instructions for installing 
components on the bottom of the board. 
 Locate the Spacer Set PC board (Figure 5-1).  Using long-nose 
pliers, carefully break out the pushbutton switch spacing tool and the 
four backlight LED spacers. Break the material only at the four 
indicated points. Note: The switch spacing tool doubles as the PC 
board for the RF probe, which will be assembled later. 
 
SWITCH SPACINGTOOL
 
Figure 5-1 
 
 Position pushbutton switches S1 and S2 as shown in Figure 5-2, 
using the switch spacing tool to set the switch height. Make sure all 
four legs of each switch are centered in their holes, then gently push 
each switch until it is resting flush against the switch-spacing tool. 
(Caution: switch pins are fragile.) Do not solder yet.

Figure 5-3 
Figure 5-3 shows a side view of a switch that is properly mounted 
(spacing tool not shown). The leads of the switches will just be visible 
on the bottom of the board. Proper switch height is important for 
maintaining an even appearance. 
 Once you’re satisfied that S1 and S2 are seated correctly, solder 
the leads (on the bottom side of the board). Leave the spacing tool in 
place until you’ve finished soldering both switches.  
 Install the remaining switches, S3-S16, using the same technique. 
When you get to S8 through S16, you may install three switches at a 
time using the spacing tool.  
 Install the following 1/4-watt fixed resistors, which are listed in 
left-to-right PC board order. Solder the resistors after all have been 
installed. (R13 and a few other parts are part of the SSB adapter 
option, and are not included in the basic K2 kit. A check-list of these 
components is provided at the end of this section.) 
 
__ R12, 120 (BRN-RED-BRN)  __ R10, 33 (ORG-ORG-BLK) 
__ R9, 220 (RED-RED-BRN) 
__ R11, 470 (YEL-VIO-BRN) 
__ R6, 4.7 k (YEL-VIO-RED) 
__ R7, 4.7 k (YEL-VIO-RED) 
__ R14, 100 k (BRN-BLK-YEL) 
 
 Install the following resistors on the bottom of the board. Solder 
them on the bottom side. Keep your iron tip away from the bodies of 
the resistors. 
 
__ R16, 15 k (BRN-GRN-ORG) 
__ R15, 10 k (BRN-BLK-ORG) 
i
  When you install the resistor networks in the next step, 
you must align the dotted end of the network with the pin 1 label 
on the PC board outline.  
 Install the resistor networks listed below (top side of the board). 
Double-check pin 1 orientation and values before soldering.  
 
__ RP2, 120, 10 pins (770101121)  (dotted end should be near "RP2" label) 
__ RP1, 100 k, 10 pins (10A1.104G)  (dotted end near "RP1" label) 
 
 Install and solder the diodes listed below, observing proper 
orientation as described in the previous section. 
 
__ D4, 1N5817  
__ D5, 1N5817  
__ D6, 1N5817 
 
 Install and solder the following capacitors. C9 is located on the 
bottom of the board and must be soldered on the top side.  
 
__ C1, .047 (473) __ C2, .01 (103)  
__ C3, .047 (473) 
 
__ C9, .01 (103), on bottom 
 
 Install PN2222A transistors at Q1 and Q2, near the middle of the 
board, and solder. These transistors must be mounted so the lead 
length above the PC board is less than 1/8" (3 mm) to prevent them 
from hitting the front panel. 
 There are two ground jumpers on the Front Panel board, one at 
the far left and the other at the lower right, labeled with a 
 symbol. 
Use discarded component leads to make 3/4" (19 mm) long U-shaped 
wires for each jumper. Solder them on the bottom side.  
 Install a 40-pin IC socket at U1, on the bottom of the board. (The 
IC will be inserted into this socket later.)  Orient the notched end of 
the socket to the left as shown on the PC board outline.

  The ICs to be installed in the next step are very sensitive to 
static discharge. Touch a grounded surface before handling each 
IC. Also note that U4's label will read upside-down (pin 1 at the 
right) when properly installed. 
Install the following ICs. Before soldering, verify that the ICs are 
oriented correctly (pin 1 associated with a round or oval pad).

  The bargraph LED will be installed in the following two steps. 
This component must be seated flat on the PC board or it will interfere 
with final front panel assembly. Also, any misalignment will be visible 
from the front of the K2. 
Locate the bargraph LED, DS2. The bargraph has a beveled 
corner or edge that indicates pin 1. Install DS2 as shown by its PC 
board outline, just to the left of the LCD. Bend two opposite corner 
pins slightly to hold it to the board, then solder only these two pins. 
If the bargraph is not perfectly flat against the PC board, re-heat 
the solder on the corner pins alternately while pressing it down. There 
may be small nubs on the back of the bargraph LED. If so do not 
remove them. Simply be sure all four nubs are against the PC board. 
Once it is in the correct position, solder the remaining pins. 
i
  Double check to ensure you have soldered ALL the pins on 
the LED bargraph. Many builders miss pin 1. 
Remove any hardware supplied with the microphone jack, J2. The 
nut and washer will not be used.  
Install the microphone jack (J2) in the lower left-hand corner of 
the board, with its polarizing nub at the top (Figure 5-4). Press the jack 
down until it is completely flat against the PC board. Re-check the 
orientation of the polarizing nub before soldering.

Install two 3/16" (4.8 mm) diameter x 1/4" (6.4 mm) long round 
standoffs on the top of the board, adjacent to the microphone jack 
(Figure 5-5). Use two #4 lock washers between each standoff and the 
PC board as shown. Secure the standoffs from the bottom side with 
chassis screws. Recall that "chassis screw" is short-hand for 3/16" (4.8

round standoff on the top of the PC board, on the left side of the large 
square hole in the middle of the board. The standoff mounting hole is 
below C2. Use the same hardware as indicated in Figure 5-5, including 
two #4 lock washers and one chassis screw.  
Install two 1/4" (6.4 mm) diameter x 1/2" (12.7 mm) long hex 
standoffs on the bottom of the board (Figure 5-6). The holes for these 
standoffs are indicated by large pads on the top and bottom of the 
board. Use one lock washer and a chassis screw for each standoff. 
Insert the lock washer between the standoff and PC board.

Identify the two different types of panel-mount potentiometers. 
Four of them are 5-kohm linear-taper types, labeled "B5K". The fifth 
is an audio-taper type, labeled "A5K". They may be physically 
identical or have slightly different shafts, body colors, etc. 
i
  When you install the panel-mount potentiometers in the 
next two steps, do not push on the shafts, which may damage the 
part. Push only on the metal frame.
Install the audio-taper potentiometer, R3, in the lower left-hand 
corner. (The PCB is labeled "AUDIO" at R3.) Push only on the 
frame, not the shaft. Make sure that the potentiometer body is parallel 
to the PC board and is pressed against the board as far as it will go 
before soldering.  
Install the four 5-k linear-taper potentiometers at R1, R2, R4, and 
R5. (The PC board is labeled "LINEAR" at each pot.) Verify correct 
positioning as you did in the previous step. 
i
  Before installing J1 in the following step, review Figure 
3-3 (page 8) to be sure you have J1 on the correct side of the 
board.  
The front panel attaches to the RF board via J1, a 20-pin single-
row female connector. Install J1 on the bottom side of the board 
(Figure 5-7). Solder just two pins, one at either end.

  Before handling U1, touch an unpainted, grounded metal 
surface or put on a conductive wrist-strap. 
Straighten the pins of U1, the LCD driver (PCF8566), as you did 
with the microcontroller on the Control board. 
Insert U1 into its socket on the bottom of the board. (This must be 
done before continuing with LCD installation, since the LCD’s 
presence will make pressing U1 into its socket much more difficult.)  
Be sure that U1 is completely seated with no bent pins. 
Locate the LCD backlight assembly, which is about 3" (7.5 cm) 
long. It includes the diffuser and two small LEDs, one at each end. Do 
not remove the  backing from either side of the diffuser. 
Make sure the LEDs in the LCD backlight assembly are pressed 
into the diffuser and are not mis-aligned or loose. 
 Position the backlight assembly between the mounting holes 
labeled D2 and D3 as shown in Figures 5-9 and 5-10 with two 3/4" (19 
mm) long spacers under each end. The diffuser must be parallel to and 
1/8" (3 mm) above the PC board. Use a rubber band to hold the 
backlight assembly and spacers in place.

  CAUTION:  The LCD and its pins are fragile—handle 
carefully. Do not drop the LCD on a hard surface, as it is made of 
glass and may break. Do not remove the protective plastic film from 
the front surface of the LCD until later in this section when the front 
panel assembly is completed. 
Carefully remove the LCD from its packing materials.  
i
  CAUTION:  Do not peel off the thick plastic material on 
either side of the LCD, or the LCD will have to be replaced (not 
covered under warranty). 
Hold the LCD up to a bright light and look at both sides for the 
presence of a very thin, clear protective film (like transparent tape). All 
LCDs have such film on the front surface of the LCD, which will be 
removed in a later step. But the back of some LCDs (not all) may also 
have such film, with faintly visible yellow or gray diagonal lines.  If 
protective film is found on the back side, use a fingernail at one corner 
of the LCD to dislodge it, then peel it away.  
The LCD has six pins along its lower edge (three on each side), 
and 24 pins along the upper edge. Place the LCD in its proper position 
on the board but do not solder yet. 
The LCD must be seated flat against the diffuser as shown in the 
edge view (Figure 5-11). If the LCD does not appear to be seated 
correctly, it may be because the backlight LEDs or spacers are mis-
aligned. When the assembly is installed correctly, the LCD’s pins will 
all protrude the same distance from the bottom of the board. The leads 
may not extend through the solder pad holes.  
 
 
LCD 
 
Figure 5-11 
Solder the four corner pins of the LCD, and then re-check the 
alignment of the LCD assembly. If everything looks correct, solder the 
remaining pins. LCD pins can be soldered on the top of the board if 
they do not protrude from the bottom. If the leads do not reach through 
the holes, be sure the solder fills the gap between the lead and solder 
pad (see Figure 5-9). After soldering, remove the spacers at each end. 
The leads will hold the assembly securely in place. 
 Attach two thin, 1/4" (6.4 mm) self-adhesive rubber pads to the 
bottom side of the Front Panel board in the positions indicated in 
Figure 5-12. The pads should be placed as close as possible to the 
corners, but should not hang over on either edge. These pads establish 
the correct spacing for the Front Panel board.

Front Panel Final Assembly 
 Locate the front panel chassis piece. Place it on a soft cloth to 
protect the finish and labeling. 
i
  In the following step, the paint masking material will be 
removed from the inside of the front panel. The masking material 
is usually green, but may appear gray because of paint overspray. 
DO NOT remove the masking material from the other chassis 
pieces at this time. 
 Some holes in the front panel were masked on the inside surface 
during painting. If masking tape (usually green in color) is still 
present, you'll need to remove it. The holes that are masked are in the 
four corners, along the top and bottom edges.  
 
Masking tape should be removed as follows: 
 
 
Using a blunt instrument such as a ball-point pen, push on the tape 
through a hole until the tape begins to lift away from the surface. 
 
Peel the tape completely off, using a sharp tool if necessary. Be 
careful not to nick or scratch the outer surface of the panel. 
 
 After removing any masking tape, place the front panel chassis 
piece face-down, with the large, round microphone jack hole on the 
right. 
 Locate the green plastic bargraph filter and two pieces of double-
backed tape. These items will be found in a small bag with the serial 
number label.  
i
  Caution:  The adhesive on the double-backed tape is very 
strong. Once you position the tape on the green filter, you will not 
be able to remove it. Be very careful to align the tape with the long 
edges of the filter as explained below. 
 Remove the white paper backing from one side of each piece of 
tape. Attach the tape to the long edges of the green filter (Figure 5-13). 
Be careful not to get any adhesive on the center portion of the filter, 
since it might be visible after installation.

using the four pads below the large rectangular hole (Figure 5-16).  
 Solder and trim the wires on the top side of the board. The wires 
will be connected to the optical encoder, Z1, in a later step.

 Remove the protective plastic film from the face of the LCD. Be 
careful not to scratch the glass.  Caution: Do not peel off the LCD 
glass, just the thin protective film. The LCD will not be usable if 
you lift the glass itself. 
 Insert the front panel PC board assembly into the front panel. The 
pushbutton switch caps on both sides of the LCD should protrude 
slightly as shown in the side view, Figure 5-17a.  
 
Note:  the board/panel assembly will not be rigidly held in place until 
it is mated with the RF and Control boards in a later section.

 A 1/4" (6.4 mm) standoff on the PC board should now be visible 
through the hole just to the left of the encoder mounting hole. Secure 
the panel to this standoff using the 4-40 x 3/16" (4.8 mm) flat-head 
screw as shown in Figure 5-17b.

 Open the K2 Encoder Assembly Kit (K2ENCASY) and follow 
the instructions included with it to install the encoder.  
 Set all potentiometers to midway in their rotation. 
i
  In the next step, a small knob may fit too tightly onto its 
potentiometer shaft. If so, rotate the shaft until it bumps up against one 
of its stops, place the knob at the top of the shaft, and rotate it slowly 
in the same direction while gently pressing it down. 
 Attach small knobs to the potentiometer shafts, starting with the 
KEYER and POWER controls. Each knob's two set screws can be 
tightened using the small Allen wrench (.050", 1.3 mm). The knobs 
should be mounted as close as possible to the panel without touching 
it. Align the pointers per panel labeling. 
 Locate the 1" (25 mm) dia. by 1/16" (1.6 mm) thick felt washer, 
and place it over the encoder nut (Figure 5-19). The washer should be 
seated on the front panel, with the nut inside it. 
 
 
Figure 5-18 
 Place the large knob on the encoder shaft. Push the knob on until 
it just touches the felt washer. If the knob does not spin freely, move it 
out slightly. If the knob is not contacting the felt washer at all, it may 
"drift" slightly once it stops spinning. 
 Using the larger Allen wrench (5/64", 2 mm), tighten the two set 
screws alternately, in small increments. 
i
  At this point, the pushbutton switches may not all protrude an 
equal distance. The switch height will become equalized once the front 
panel assembly is mated to the RF board in a later step.

6. RF Board 
Most of the K2’s receiver and transmitter circuits are located on the 
RF board, including filters, oscillators, and RF amplifiers. The front 
panel and Control boards plug into the RF board, and the  chassis 
pieces are designed to form a tight enclosure around it (see photos in 
Appendix D). In addition, many option boards plug directly into the 
RF board to minimize wiring. 
 
Assembly and testing of the RF board is broken into three parts: 
 
Part I: The DC and control circuits are installed so that the front panel 
and Control boards can be plugged in and tested. The I/O controller 
(U1 on the RF board) is also installed and tested at this time. Once this 
phase of assembly is completed, you’ll have the K2’s built-in test 
equipment available for testing and aligning the remaining circuits. 
 
Part II: Synthesizer and receiver components are installed and tested. 
By the end of Part II you’ll have the K2 receiving on 40 meters. 
 
Part III. Transmitter components and all remaining filter components 
are installed. The K2 is then aligned on all bands. 
 
Components 
i
  Review anti-static precautions before handling transistors or 
ICs. 
 Open the bags labeled RF and sort the components into related 
groups. In later steps you’ll sort some of the components according to 
value to reduce the likelihood of assembly errors. 
 Locate the RF board and place it in front of you with the 
component side up (the side with most of the parts), and the front edge 
facing you (the edge with the irregular cutouts). Throughout this 
section we’ll refer to the different areas of the board in terms of their 
proximity to you. For example, "front-left" means the corner closest to 
you on the left.

 Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the RF board using 
Figure 6-1 to identify the major sections. If you flip the board over 
you’ll see that there are a few components on the bottom of the board, 
primarily in the transmitter section.

Assembly, Part I 
Locate a 2-D fastener and hold it vertically as shown in Figure 
6-2. Looking at a side with two holes, note that the holes are offset 
from the center. When you install the fasteners in the following step, 
be sure to position them so that the holes in the fastener are shifted in 
the same direction as the holes in the PC board outlines on the bottom 
of the board. 
Install 2-D fasteners at 5 locations on the bottom of the board as 
shown in Figure 6-3. Secure each fastener from the top side of the 
board using two chassis screws (black, 3/16" [4.7 mm]) and two #4 
lock washers. The washers go on the top side of the board.

Make sure that the 2-D fasteners on the edges line up with the 
edge of the PC board and do not hang over. If they hang over or do not 
match their component outlines, they are installed backwards. 
 Install two 3/16" (4.8 mm) diameter by 1/4" (6.4 mm) long round 
standoffs on the bottom of the board at the locations identified in 
Figure 6-3. Secure these standoffs from the top side with chassis 
screws and #4 lock washers. Do not put lock washers between the 
bottom of the board and the standoffs. 
 Turn the board back over to the top side. Install the 28-pin IC 
socket at U1, near the middle of the board (Figure 6-1). The notched 
end of the socket should be at the left. Make sure the socket is flat 
against the PC board before soldering. (U1 itself will be installed in a 
later step.) 
i
  In the following steps you will install the latching relays (K1-
K17). Relay pins must not be bent or trimmed, even after placement on 
the PC board, as this may cause unreliable mechanical operation. 
Since the pins cannot be bent to hold the relays on the board, an 
alternative assembly technique using a flat surface must be used. For 
this technique to work, the relays must be installed before any of the 
taller components. 
 Place relays K1 through K17 on the top side of the RF board. 
One end of each relay has a heavy line printed across the top to 
indicate the pin 1 end. This end must be matched with the same end of 
the relay’s PC board outline. Do not solder the relays yet. 
 When all of the relays have been placed on the board, lay a flat 
object such as a book or piece of cardboard on top of the relays to keep 
them in place, then flip the board over.  
 Solder only two pins (at opposite corners) on each relay. Do not 
bend or trim relay leads. 
 Turn the board back over and verify that all of the relays are in 
the correct orientation and are seated flat on the board.  
 Solder all of the remaining relay pins. 
 Install R1 and R2 (220 ohms, RED-RED-BRN), near the back 
left corner of the board. 
i
  To avoid stray signal coupling, all capacitors on the RF board 
must be mounted as close to the PC board as possible (without 
damaging the leads or their epoxy coating). 
 Install C1 and C2 (.001 µF, "102"), which are on the left edge. 
 Install electrolytic capacitors C105 and C106 (2.2 µF), located 
near the front-left corner. 
 Install R35 and R36 (82, GRY-RED-BLK) just to the right of 
C105.  
 Install R115 (.05 ohms, 3 watts) at the front right corner of the 
board. Form the leads as indicated by the component outline. 
 Install the following components to the left of R115. 
__ C111, 2.2 µF electrolytic 
 ("+" lead goes into the square pad)  
__ R113, 82 (GRY-RED-BLK) 
 Install the internal speaker connector, P5, which is a 2-pin 
connector like that shown in Figure 4-5. P5 is mounted near the on-off 
switch (S1). Position the connector as shown by its component outline, 
with the vertical locking ramp toward S1. 
 Install high-current diodes D10 and D12 (large black body), 
located near the right edge of the board: 
__ D10, 95SQ015 
__ D12, SB530        (a 1N5821 may be substituted for D12) 
 Install the following components near D10: 
__ C77, .001 (102) 
 
__ C196, .047 (473) 
__ R69, 100 k (BRN-BLK-YEL) 
__ R66, 2.7 k (RED-VIO-RED)

 Install the self-resetting fuse, F1, near D10. F1 is yellow and 
looks like a square-bodied capacitor. One side is labeled "G300". 
 Install the key jack, J1, at the back-left corner of the board. 
Before soldering, make sure that the jack is aligned with its PC board 
outline. 
 Install the headphone jack, J2, on the small board extension near 
the front left corner. The pins on J2 are not very long, so they will be 
nearly flush with the bottom of the board. Solder the pin closest to the 
front edge first (ground), then verify that the jack is seated flat on its 
plastic nubs before soldering the remaining pins. 
 Install the power switch, S1, at the right front corner. (S1's key 
cap will be installed later.) 
 Install the DC input jack, J3, at the back right corner. The 3 leads 
on the jack must be lined up with the slot-shaped holes in the 
component outline. If the holes are a tight fit, press firmly until the 
connector snaps into position.  
 Install the antenna jack, J4 (BNC), just to the left of J3. 
 Install the following components near U1 (at the middle of the 
board). You may need to confirm the part number of U2 (78L06), 
since it is easy to confuse it with U8 (78L05). Use a magnifying glass 
if necessary. 
 
__ U2 (78L06) 
 
 
__ C139, 0.1 (104) 
 
__ C140, .001 (102) 
 
__ R64, 100 (BRN-BLK-BRN) 
 
 Install the ceramic resonator, Z5, near U1. (Z5 looks like a 
capacitor with 3 pins.) It can be installed in either orientation. 
 Install R65 (10 k, BRN-BLK-ORG) on the bottom of the board, 
near U1. 
 Install D8 and D18 (1N4148), on the bottom of the board, toward 
the right edge. Make sure the banded end of each diode is aligned with 
the band on its component outline. 
i
  In the steps that follow you’ll install the connectors that mate 
with the control and Front Panel boards. These connectors must be 
installed properly to ensure reliable mechanical connection. They are 
very difficult to remove once installed, so follow all instructions 
carefully. Review Figure 3-3 (page 8) for correct placement. 
 Install the 6-pin, single-row female connector, J6, which is just 
left of the power switch. It must be seated vertically on the board and 
must not be tilted (Figure 6-4). Solder just one pin near the center of 
J6. 
J6 
 
Figure 6-4 
 If J6 does not appear to be completely flush with the board, re-
heat the soldered pin and press down. Once it is installed correctly, 
solder the remaining pins. 
 Install the 20-pin, dual-row female connector, J8, near the front 
left corner of the board. Use the same technique you used for J6. This 
connector must be seated flush with the board before soldering. 
 Install 36-pin dual-row female connector J7 in the same manner 
as J6 and J8.

 Position 20-pin male right-angle connector P1 on the bottom of 
the board (Figure 6-5), but do not solder P1 yet. Review Figure 3-3 
(page 8) for correct placement. The short ends of the bent pins are 
inserted into the holes, and the long ends must be parallel with the 
board.  
Front edge

Figure 6-5 
 Solder just the two end pins of P1. 
 Look closely at P1 to make sure that its plastic support is pressed 
down as far as it will go, and that the pins are parallel to the board. If 
not, re-heat the soldered ends while pressing it into place. Once it is 
seated properly, solder the remaining pins. 
 To the left and right of the I/O controller, U1, you’ll find two 
short jumpers labeled "
" or  "GND"  (on the top side of the board). 
Form 3/4" (19 mm) long U-shaped ground jumpers and install them at 
these locations as you did on the control and Front Panel boards. Use 
discarded component leads. 
On the bottom of the board you’ll find two additional ground 
jumpers, one near the middle and the other near the back edge. Install 
U-shaped ground jumpers in these two locations. 
i
  Before handling U1, touch an unpainted, grounded metal 
surface or put on a conductive wrist-strap. 
 Install the I/O controller, U1 (PIC16F872 or 16F872A), in its 
socket (near the middle of the board). Be sure to align the notched or 
dimpled end of U1 with the notched end of the socked (to the left). 
Make sure U1 is seated as far down in the socket as it will go and that 
none of its pins are bent. Note: The revision label on U1 may not be 
oriented in the same direction as the text printed on the IC. Use only 
the notch or dimple to identify the pin 1 end. 
 
Visual Inspection 
 Examine the RF board carefully for unsoldered pins, solder 
bridges, or cold solder joints. 
 Set switch S1 on the RF board to the "OFF" position. (Plunger 
OUT is OFF, plunger IN is ON.)

  When working with the side panels in the following steps, 
place a soft cloth on your work surface to protect the paint.  
 Locate the two side panels. Remove any masking tape from the 
panels using the same technique described in the Front Panel section, 
taking care not to scratch the outer surfaces. 
 Arrange the two panels as shown in Figure 6-6, and verify that 
they are mirror images of each other. The 2-D fasteners to be attached 
in the next step go on the inside surface, which has bare aluminum 
areas that were masked during painting. (Note: the actual size and 
shape of masked areas may vary.)

  Since the K2 chassis is made up of a number of individual 
panels and fasteners, you may need to loosen the fasteners and readjust 
them once or twice during assembly.  
Attach the side panels to the RF board using two chassis screws 
per side panel. The side panels are attached to the 2-D fasteners that 
are already in place on the RF board. Figure 6-8 shows the 
approximate location of the two screws used to secure the right side 
panel. 
 
Figure 6-8 
Locate the tilt stand, which can be found in the 
MISCELLANEOUS component bag. It has three parts:  two oval feet 
and a tilt bail (Figure 6-9).  Note: the screws that will be used to hold 
the tilt bail in place are not the black anodized type. They are standard 
steel/zinc plated screws, 7/16" (11 mm) long, so you won’t confuse 
them with the 3/8" (9.5 mm) or 1/2" (12 mm) black screws.  
Remove any masking tape from the bottom cover chassis piece. 
Each oval foot has a notch into which the bail will be inserted. 
Install one of the oval feet on the bottom cover using two 7/16" (11 
mm) 4-40 screws, #4 lock washers, and 4-40 nuts. The notch in the 
foot should be facing inwards (toward the other foot). The nuts and 
lock washers go on the inside of the bottom cover. 
Install the tilt bail, then the second oval foot. The bail should be 
compressed firmly between the two feet. You may need to adjust the 
positions of the feet slightly before tightening the hardware.  
 Make sure the two feet are at exactly the same distance from the 
front edge of the bottom cover. If they are not equally spaced, the tilt 
stand may "rock" when in use.

Turn the RF board/side panel assembly upside down. Check for 
any untrimmed component leads on the bottom of the board. 
Position the bottom cover as shown in Figure 6-10, then secure it 
using six chassis screws. (The heat sink and rear feet will not be 
installed until Part III when the transmitter is assembled.) 
With the entire assembly still upside down or resting on one side 
panel, plug the front panel assembly into the RF board (Figure 6-10). 
Align the two assemblies so that connector J1 on the bottom of the 
front panel PC board mates with P1 on the bottom of the RF board. 
The arrow in Figure 6-10 shows the approximate location of P1 on the 
RF board. 
 Once the front panel assembly is in place, the headphone jack (on 
the RF board) should be just flush with the front panel. The small 
rubber pads in the upper corners of the Front Panel board should be 
just touching the 2-D fasteners on the RF board. If this is not the case, 
the front panel must be pushed farther in. 
Secure the front panel to the side panels and RF board using 4 
chassis screws. (Refer to the photos in Appendix D.) You may need to 
make slight adjustments to the 2-D fasteners at the top edge.

 Plug the Control board assembly into the RF board, with the 
component side of the Control board facing backwards. (Refer to the 
photos in Appendix D.) All three connectors on the Control board 
must be lined up with the three connectors on the RF board at all pins.  
 Make sure the Control board is pushed as far down as it will go; 
it should be flat against the RF board along its entire edge, with all 
three connectors properly mated. 
i
  If the Control board does not plug in easily, you may have one 
or more connectors installed incorrectly.  
 The long-handled Allen wrench can be used to extract the 
Control board (Figure 6-11). To the left of J7 on the RF board you’ll 
find the label "LIFT" near a hole at the base of the Control board. 
Insert the Allen wrench into this hole, then rest the knee of the wrench 
on the nearby screw head. Pry the board up with the wrench while 
guiding the board out at the top.

Control board may be touching the 2-D fasteners, or there may be a 
small gap.

Alignment and Test, Part 1 
 
In this section you’ll test most of the circuits on the Control board and 
front panel. Along the way you’ll become familiar with basic 
operation of the K2, including use of the front panel switches, display, 
and menu. 
 Before proceeding with initial test, turn to the first page of the 
Operation section of the manual to familiarize yourself with the K2’s 
front panel layout. Do not turn on power to the K2 at this time. 
 
The Tap/Hold Rule 
 
Each of the push-button switches on the front panel has two functions, 
one activated by a TAP (short press) and the other activated by a 
HOLD (long press, about 1/2 second). The upper label on each switch 
shows the TAP function (white lettering), and the lower label shows 
the HOLD function (yellow lettering). To highlight this in the text, we 
use two different typographical styles to identify switches: TAP  and  
HOLD . 
 
Initial Test 
i
  If any test or alignment step fails, refer to the Troubleshooting 
section (Appendix E). 
 Set the controls on the front panel as follows: 
 
AF GAIN: 
midway (12 o’clock) 
RF GAIN: 
maximum (clockwise) 
KEYER: 
midway 
POWER: 
minimum (counter-clockwise) 
OFFSET: 
midway 
 
 Locate P7 on the Control board. A shorting jumper should be 
installed onto the two pins of P7 nearest the "P7" label. 
 For the remaining test and alignment steps, you’ll need a well-
regulated 12-14 V power supply or a battery. A power supply rated at 
300 mA or more of output current will suffice for the tests in Parts I 
and II, but higher currents (3-3.5 A) will be needed for transmitter 
tests in Part III.  
 If your power supply or battery does not already have a plug that 
mates with the power jack (J3), use the supplied mating plug and 
prepare a suitable power cable. The center lead of the plug is positive 
(+).  
 Make sure the K2 is turned OFF (power switch S1 out). Plug 
your power supply or battery into J3 on the rear panel. 
 Fold the tilt stand out to improve the viewing angle if desired. 
i
 If you see or smell smoke when you turn the K2 on for the first 
time, turn off power and disconnect the power supply immediately. 
Normally, you should hear the relays being reset by the I/O controller. 
Next, nonvolatile configuration memory (EEPROM) will be 
initialized. This process takes approximately 10 seconds. During this 
period, you should see  INFO 201 on the LCD. Displays of this 
kind are referred to as "INFO messages," and are used to alert you to 
possible problems. In this case, the info message is just a reminder that 
EEPROM has been initialized. 
 Turn on the K2 using S1. After about 10 seconds, you should see 
the default K2 frequency display for 40 meters:  7100.00c. The 
letter C indicates CW mode. The annunciator for VFO A will also be 
turned on. (If you see any other INFO messages or the display does 
not come on, refer to Troubleshooting.) 

============================================================

 Turn the K2 off and wait for a few seconds, then turn it back on. 
The display should now show ELECRAFT for about two seconds, 
followed by the frequency display. Now that the EEPROM is 
initialized, this is the display you should always see on power-up. The 
"R" and "T" in "ELECRAFT" appear in lower-case letters due to the 
limitations of the seven-segment LCD characters. 
 Tap the DISPLAY switch once to select voltage/current display. 
The display should now show something similar to this: 
 
 
E12.0 i0.08 
 
This would indicate that the power supply voltage (E) is about 12.0 V, 
and the supply current  (I) is about 80-100 mA.7 
 
Optical Encoder Test 
 Tap the DISPLAY switch to return to the frequency display. 
 Turn the VFO knob in both directions and verify that the 
displayed frequency changes accordingly.  
 Tap the RATE switch to the right of the knob to change the 
tuning rate, and repeat the VFO test at each rate.  
 
Relay Test 
 Tap  BAND+ . After a short delay the K2 will switch to the next 
band. At the same time, you’ll hear one or more relays.  
 Tap the BAND+ switch 7 more times to verify that you hear 
relays being switched with each band change. Note: The 1.8 MHz 
(160 m) and 5 MHz (60 m) bands will not appear in the band list 
unless the associated options are installed. This can be done only after 
assembly and alignment have been completed. 
                                                     
7 The supply voltage reading will reflect a small drop across D10, the reverse-
polarity protection diode, typically 0.1 V on receive. Current readings may 
vary at this stage of assembly, but should be under 150 mA. 
 Tap the PRE/ATTN switch three times. You should hear relays

The Switch Spacing Tool used during Front Panel can now be used as 
the PC board for the RF probe. All parts for the probe, including a 
ground alligator clip, 2 feet of RG174 coax, and banana plugs for a 
DMM, are supplied with the kit. You can assemble the probe at any 
time, using the instructions on page 9 of Appendix E. 
 
Voltmeter Probe Assembly 
 
If you do not have a DMM (digital multimeter), you can use the 
simple DC voltage probe shown below in conjunction with the built-in 
voltmeter. The crimp pin and 2-pin housing can be found in the 
MISCELLANEOUS components bag. 
 Assemble the voltage probe as shown in Figure 6-13 using green-
insulated hookup wire. No ground connection is needed since you will 
be measuring voltages inside the K2.

 Move the voltage select jumper (Control board, P7) toward P5. 
Select voltage/current display mode using the DISPLAY switch. The 
voltage reading on the LCD should go to 00.0.  
 To test the voltage probe, touch the tinned end of the hookup 
wire to pin 1 of the I/O controller, U1 (RF board). The voltage 
displayed on the LCD should be approximately 6 V. 
 Return the voltage select jumper to the "12 V" position. 
 
Note: Always disconnect the voltage probe when it is not in use.  
It may cause shorts or noise pickup if left inside the K2 during normal 
operation  
 
Menu Tutorial 
 
We’ll present a brief tutorial on using the menu here. A complete list 
of menu functions can be found in the Operation section. 
 
Tap the MENU switch on the K2. The first entry will be displayed: 
 
 
ST L 040 
 
This is the sidetone level menu entry. 040 is the associated 
parameter, in this case the sidetone volume setting. The row of 
annunciators under  ST L serves as an underline, indicating that 
turning the VFO knob will change the menu entries. 
 
Tap the MENU switch again and you’ll return to the frequency or 
voltage/current display, depending on what display mode was selected 
when you entered the menu.  
 
Tap MENU again to bring up the menu. Turn the VFO knob now, and 
you’ll see the other menu entries and their parameters scroll by. (You 
can also tap the BAND+ or BAND- switches to scroll through menu 
entries.)   Scroll the menu until you see 
 
 
INP HAND 
 
This menu entry is used to select the keying device. HAND means 
that the key jack is configured for a hand key or external keyer.  
 
Press and hold the EDIT switch for 1/2 second to activate the EDIT 
function. (Remember the TAP/HOLD rule:  when you HOLD a switch 
in, you activate the function indicated by the lower label on the 
switch.)  The display should now show: 
 
 
INP HAND 
 
Notice that the underline has moved to the parameter (HAND). This 
tells you that you’re in EDIT mode, and that turning the VFO knob 
will now change the parameter for the current menu entry. You can 
also change the parameter using BAND+ and BAND-. 
 
Turn the VFO knob now to see the various keying input selections. 
PDLn and PDLr configure the key jack for a keyer paddle, wired 
for either normal (tip = dot) or reverse (tip = dash) operation. 
 
Tap the MENU switch again to exit EDIT mode. The underline should 
return to the menu entry.

Using the Calibration Functions 
 
Scroll the menu until you see CAL OFF. This is the entry point into 
the calibration sub-menu, which you’ll be using during alignment.  
 
Enter EDIT mode by holding EDIT as before, moving the underline to 
the OFF parameter. Then turn the VFO knob to see the various CAL 
functions, including FCTR (frequency counter), CUR (transmit 
current limiting), tPA (KPA100 temperature calibration),  S LO / 
S HI (S-meter calibration), FIL (crystal filter configuration), and 
PLL (VFO calibration). 
 
Once you select a CAL function, holding EDIT again activates the 
function. The selected CAL function remains active until you tap 
MENU again, which returns you to the menu. Another tap of MENU 
returns you to the normal K2 display. 
 
In the following section you’ll activate the CAL FCTR (frequency 
counter) function. For now, just tap MENU once or twice to return to 
the normal display. 
 
Frequency Counter Probe Assembly 
 In the bag labeled MISCELLANEOUS you’ll find the 
components for the frequency counter probe (Figure 6-14). These 
components include a 10 pF axial-lead capacitor, two crimp pins, a 2-
pin housing, and a 1-pin male connector (probe tip).  
 Cut a 7" (18 cm) length of RG-174 cable and carefully remove 
1/2" (13 mm) of the coax jacket from each end. Be careful not to nick 
the braid. 
 Separate the braid from the center conductor at both ends. 
Remove 1/4" (6 mm) of insulation from each center conductor. At one 
end, cut the braid off completely right at the coax jacket (a ground 
connection will not be needed for frequency measurements). The braid 
should be twisted into a fine bundle at the other end. 
 Solder crimp pins onto the center conductor and shield at the 
housing end of the cable. Solder quickly, so that the heat from 
soldering does not melt the center insulator of the coax and cause a 
shield-to-center short. 
 Insert the pins into the crimp housing as shown in Figure 6-14. 
They should snap into place. Each crimp pin has a small tab on the 
back that latches into a hole in the housing. 
 Trim the leads of the 10 pF axial-lead capacitor down to 1/4" (6 
mm). Solder one end to the center conductor of the coax cable.

 Solder the probe tip to the other end of the 10 pF capacitor.  
 Slip a 1" (2.5 cm) length of the larger size heatshrink tubing onto 
the probe tip components. Shrink the tubing using a heat gun. (You 
can also use a soldering iron, but avoid melting the tubing.) 
 Add a second, identical length of heatshrink tubing on top of the 
first, then shrink it. This strengthens the assembly. 
 Plug the frequency counter probe assembly into P6, which is at 
the far left end of the Control board (as viewed from the front of the 
transceiver). The connector can only be plugged in one way.

 Turn on the K2 and tap MENU to bring up the menu, then scroll 
to the CAL menu entry. Hold EDIT, then scroll the CAL parameter 
until the display shows CAL FCTR. Hold EDIT again to activate 
the frequency counter function of the CAL sub-menu. The LCD 
should show  00000.00. (The frequency counter circuitry is 
sensitive, so it may pick up a stray signal and show it on the display.) 
 To test the counter, you can read the frequency of the 4 MHz 
oscillator on the Control board. Touch the counter probe tip to the left 
side of trimmer capacitor C22, which is just below U1, the 
microcontroller. The LCD should now read within +/- .02 kHz of 
04000.00.8 
 Remove the frequency counter probe.  
 
Audio Amplifier and Tone Generator Test 
 Plug in a pair of low-impedance (4 to 32 ohm) headphones, 
stereo or mono. 
 Tap MENU and scroll to the sidetone level menu entry (ST L). 
Hold EDIT to activate the sidetone. You should now hear a clean 600-
Hz audio tone. Turning the VFO knob should vary the volume.  
 Notice that turning the AF GAIN control does not affect the 
sidetone volume. The sidetone is injected into the AF amplifier after 
the volume control, so AF GAIN affects only the receiver volume. 
 Tap MENU to turn off the sidetone, then scroll up to the sidetone 
pitch menu entry (ST P) using the VFO knob or by tapping the 
BAND+ switch. The display will show:  
ST P 0.60 
                                                     
8 This is not a valid indication of how well the 4 MHz oscillator is calibrated, 
since this oscillator is used as the reference for the frequency counter itself. 
The 4 MHz counter will be calibrated in a later step. 
This indicates that the sidetone pitch is set for 0.60 kHz (600 Hz). 
Hold EDIT to turn on the sidetone, then vary the VFO knob. The pitch 
of the sidetone should change to match the display. 
 
Keyer 
 
In the following steps you’ll test the keyer (audio tone generation 
only). This tests the keyer jack, speed control, and potentiometer read 
circuits, including the A-to-D converter on the microcontroller. 
Tap MODE until C is displayed at the right end of the LCD, 
indicating CW mode. 
Plug a keyer paddle into the key jack. The plug must be stereo (2 
circuit). A mono plug will key the transmitter continuously. (A mating 
stereo plug for the keyer jack is supplied with the kit.) 
 Using the menu’s INP entry, set up the keyer input for either  
PDLn or  PDLr as described previously. 
 Adjust the KEYER control. As soon as you turn it, the display 
should show the keying speed (approx. 9-50 WPM). 
 While listening with headphones, test the keyer paddle to verify 
that both dot and dash are working. 
 
Note: No sidetone will be generated when LSB or USB mode is 
selected (L or U). 
 
Setting the AGC Threshold  
 Make sure the RF GAIN control is rotated fully clockwise. 
 Locate potentiometer R1 on the Control board (right side, as 
viewed from the front of the K2).  
 Set your DMM for DC volts. Connect the (-) lead of the DMM to 
one of the ground jumpers or to the K2 chassis ground.  

============================================================

    ELECRAFT® 
 Touch the (+) lead to pin 5 of U2 on the Control board. (U2 is 
located just above trimmer R1. Pin 5 is the pin nearest diode D1.) 
 Adjust R1 for a reading of 3.80 volts on the DMM. This is the 
suggested setting, but it can be adjusted later to suit the operator. If 
you cannot set the voltage to 3.8 volts, turn to the AGC Level 
application note included with your kit and follow those instructions to 
add the 15K resistor to the control board. An extra 15K resistor is 
included in your K2 kit for that purpose.  
i
  The S-meter must be realigned anytime the AGC 
threshold setting is changed. S-meter alignment is covered in the 
following steps. 
 
S-Meter Alignment 
 Using the menu, select the CAL S LO function (S-meter zero). 
Hold EDIT a second time to activate it. 
 Turn the VFO knob until you see only the left-most segment of 
the LED bargraph lit. Then turn the knob a bit more clockwise until 
this LED just turns off. 
 Exit the CAL S LO function by tapping MENU. Enter the 
menu again and select CAL S HI (S-meter full-scale sensitivity).  
 Turn RF GAIN fully counter-clockwise. Adjust the VFO knob 
until bargraph segment 9 lights, then turn it a bit more counter-
clockwise until segment 10 just turns on (right-most segment). 
 Turn the RF GAIN control back to its full clockwise position. 
 Exit the CAL S HI function by tapping MENU. 
i
 After you complete assembly, the S-meter can be further 
calibrated for an S-9 reading with a 50 µV signal level if you have an 
Elecraft XG1 or XG2 test oscillator or other calibrated signal source 
(see page 90).  
Bargraph Current Test 
In the following steps, you’ll test the current measurement circuit by 
using the bargraph LEDs to establish a known current drain. 
 Enter the menu and verify that GRPH (LED bargraph mode) is 
set to DOT, not to BAR or OFF. 
 Set the RF GAIN control for minimum gain. Segment 10 of the 
LED bargraph should now be on if you have done the S-meter 
adjustment as described above. 
 Using the menu, select the LCD menu entry. Change the 
parameter from NITE to DAY. At this point you’ll see the LCD 
backlight turn off, and segment 10 of the LED bargraph will become 
much brighter. 
 Exit the menu and tap DISPLAY to switch to voltage/current 
mode. Write down the voltage and current readings. 
 Use the menu to change the GRPH mode to BAR. All 10 
segments of the LED should now be on. 
 Exit the menu and check the current. It should now be about 0.16 
to 0.18 amps higher. 
 Use the menu to change GRPH to DOT, and LCD to  NITE. 
i
  The combination of LCD DAY and GRPH BAR can 
result in high peak current drain on receive. DOT or  OFF are 
preferred for battery operation. See Advanced Operating Features.

Assembly, Part II 
 
In this section you’ll install the components for the synthesizer and 
receiver circuits. Most of the components to be installed are on the 
front half of the board (see Figure 6-1). After all of the parts are 
installed, individual stages will be aligned and tested. Detailed 
troubleshooting procedures are provided in the Troubleshooting 
section should you need them (Appendix E). The supplied RF probe 
will be very useful if you need to do signal tracing. RF probe assembly 
instructions start on page 9 of Appendix E. 
 
In some steps a large number of components will be installed,  then 
soldered as a group. Check for unsoldered leads after completing each 
group. A final complete check will be done later. 
Remove the screws holding the Control board to the Front Panel 
board, then unplug the Control board. To avoid damaging any Control 
board components, use the long-handled Allen wrench as described in 
Part I.  
Remove the bottom cover (six screws). 
Remove the screws from the front panel assembly and unplug it 
from the RF board. Pull it straight out from the bottom edge, near the 
middle of the panel. This may be easier to do with the transceiver 
sitting on its right side so that you can steady it with one hand and pull 
with the other. 
Remove the side panels by taking out the two screws along the 
bottom edge of each panel. 
Install the following 1/4-watt resistors, orienting them so that the 
first band is at the left or toward the back of the board. The resistors 
are listed in the order they appear on the RF board, starting with R9 
(near the left edge, about halfway back).  
 
Note:  Remember to complete each line of resistors before proceeding 
to the next line (i.e., install R9, then R16, then R10).

Install the resistor networks. Start with RP2, which is in the front 
left-hand corner. Align the pin 1 mark on each resistor network with 
the pin 1 end of its component outline. 
 
__ RP2, 10 k, 8 pins (8A3.103G)

 Locate the thermistor printed circuit board. One side will be 
labeled with THM and the letters A through F.  All components will 
be installed on the labeled side, and soldered on the other side. 
 Install 1/8th-watt resistors RB, RC, RD, RE, and RF in their 
respective positions as shown on the board.  (Color codes are listed 
above; be sure to check them carefully.) Do not pull on the resistor 
leads, as they may be fragile. Bend the leads outward. 
 Solder all of the leads. Trim off excess lead length. 
 Install resistor RA (33 k, 1/4 watt).  Solder and trim its leads. 
 Locate the thermistor, which has an orange body with black and 
brown stripes.  The thermistor is fragile, so avoid bending its leads any 
more than necessary.  Insert the thermistor at THM. (The part is 
symmetrical and can be installed in either orientation.)  Hold the 
thermistor body so that it is just touching the circuit board, then solder 
and trim its leads. 
 Remove the insulation from a 6” (15 cm) length of green hookup 
wire.  Cut the bare wire into 8 pieces of about 0.75” (2 cm) in length. 
 The remaining 8 holes on one edge of the board are used as leads 
to insert into the pads provided for the original resistor network, RP3. 
Solder one wire into each of the holes, with most of the lead 
protruding from the component side. 
 On the component side, bend each lead at a 90-degree angle so 
that it points away from the board (but parallel to it).  
Locate the position for resistor network RP3 (near the front-left 
corner, adjacent to U6). Slide each of the 8 leads of the thermistor 
board through the corresponding holes at RP3. The components on the 
thermistor board should be facing U6, and the thermistor should be 
oriented toward the location of crystal X1. (See Figure 6-14a.) 
 
    
Figure 6-14a
 
 
 Once all of the leads are inserted, slide the board down until it is 
flush against the RF Board.  It may be necessary to bend the thermistor 
board toward U6 slightly so that the solder joints on the bottom of the 
thermistor board can clear C87 on the RF board. The thermistor board 
and its parts should not be touching U6 or its pads. 
 Make sure the edge of the thermistor board is contacting the RF 
Board along its full length. Then solder the eight connections on the 
bottom side of the RF Board. 
 Examine the area closely. There should be no shorts between the 
thermistor board and nearby components.

Locate all of the small glass-bodied diodes. You should have a 
number of 1N4148 diodes, and one 1N5711, which will be similar in 
size but should have different markings. Use a piece of masking tape 
to identify the 1N5711 as "D9, 1N5711." 
Install the following diodes, located near the outline for toroidal 
transformer T5, in the synthesizer area. Be sure to orient the diodes 
according to their outlines. 
 
__ D11, 1N4148  
__ D13, 1N4148

Varactor diodes have a small plastic package, like a TO-92 
transistor, but with only two leads. Sort the varactor diodes into 
groups:  type MV209 and type 1SV149. (1SV149 diodes are labeled 
"V149" and may have a center lead that has been cut flush with the 
body of the device.) The K2 will not function correctly if the varactor 
diode types are interchanged. 
Install the MV209 diodes listed below. The flat side of each diode 
must match the flat side of its PC board outline. These diodes must be 
pushed all the way down on the board to prevent stray signal coupling. 
Bend the leads slightly to hold them in place. D16 and D23-D26 are in 
the front-left corner. D39 is to the right of J7 (Control board).

Note: Do not install D19 and D20. These are supplied with the 
K60XV option, which should not be installed until the K2 has been 
aligned and tested. 
Install type 1SV149 diodes at D37 and D38, near the SSB option 
connector. Keep them flat against the PC board, with no excess lead 
length. 
Install the remaining 1SV149 diodes listed below, keeping them 
flat against the PC board, with no excess lead length. D17, D21 and 
D22 are in the front-left corner. D29 through D34 are on the right side

Install Q21 (2N5109), which is located near U1 in the middle of 
the board. Align the small tab on the transistor’s case with the tab on 
its component outline. Bend the leads on the bottom to hold Q21 in 
place, then solder. 
Install Q22 (2N5109), which is to the right of the "ELECRAFT" 
label. Make sure Q22 is flat against the board before soldering. 
Carefully press a 3/4" (19 mm) dia. by 0.25" (6.4 mm) high star 
heat sink onto Q22. The heat sink should be pressed down as far as it 
will go, and should not touch the components around the transistor. 
The heat sink is fragile. If you need to spread it slightly, use a 
blunted wooden pencil or a plastic wire nut. 
Install Q12 (2N7000), which is to the right of Q22. 
Install Q23 (2N7000), near the right-front edge of the board. 
Install C167 (.001 µF, "102"), which is near J11, the connector for 
the SSB adapter. The leads on this capacitor should be formed to 
match its PC board outline.

Solder the pins on the bottom of the RF board. Solder a pin at 
opposite corners first, then make sure the headers are resting against 
the board. If necessary re-heat the pins while pressing the assembly 
against the board. When the assembly is in position, solder all 8 pins.   
Install U8 (78L05), which has a plastic TO-92 package like a 
transistor. U8 is located near the front left corner of the board. 
Option-bypass jumpers W5, W2 and W3 are located on the right 
side of the board, near the crystal filter. Use component leads to make 
these jumpers, or remove the insulation from appropriate lengths of 
green hookup wire. These jumpers should be formed so that they lie 
flat on the board, and should not touch any adjacent components. 
Test points TP1, TP2, and TP3 are round, yellow, single-pin 
female connectors. TP1 and TP3 can be found in the synthesizer area 
of the board. TP2 is near the SSB option connector, J11. Install and 
solder all three test points.  
NOTE: There are five 100 µH RF chokes in the kit. If one is slightly 
smaller than the others, set it aside to use at RFC15.  
Install RF choke RFC13 (100 µH, BRN-BLK-BRN), near the 
middle of the board. Orient the first color band to the left. 
Install the receive mixer, Z6 (TUF-1 or TOP-1), below the 
"ELECRAFT" label at the middle of the board. Make sure that Z6 is 
lined up with its component outline and is flush with the board before 
soldering. 
Install the electrolytic capacitors in the order listed below, starting 
with C60 near the far left-hand edge. Insert the (+) lead of each 
capacitor into the hole with the (+) symbol.

 Solder C91 (.001 µF, "102") to the two pads shown in Figure 6-
14c. Use short leads. 
 Solder C88 (68 pF, "68" or "680") between pins 12 and 13 of U4 
as shown above. Use short leads. 
 Locate the 100 µH RF choke, RFC15 (brown-black-brown). This 
choke may be the same size, or nearly so, as the other chokes. When 
installing adjust the leads to reach the pads shown in Figure 6-14c.  
 Solder RFC15 to the pads indicated above. Use short leads. 
 Examine C88, C91 and RFC15 closely. Their leads should not 
contact adjacent pads or traces. 
Locate the crystals used on the RF board:  12.096 MHz (1), 
4.9152 MHz for BFO (2) and 4.9136 MHz for crystal filters (7).  
Do not mix the BFO and filter crystals, which have different 
characteristics. 
The bag of 7 filter crystals should have a number written on it. 
Record the number here: ___________. (This identifies the tested 
frequency of the crystals, and can be used in aligning filters.) 
Install the 12.096 MHz crystal, X1, at the lower left. The crystal 
should be seated flat on the board before soldering (it is OK to bend 
the pins to hold it to the board). X2 is not used. 
To the left of X1 (along the edge of the board) you’ll find a pad 
for grounding the crystal case. Use short lengths of bare wire to 
ground the crystal on at the top of the can. 
Install the BFO crystals at X3 and X4 (near J7). Important: trim 
X3's leads, and fold them down flat against their pads, before 
soldering. Then use a minimal amount of solder. This is necessary to 
avoid interference between X3 and L33 in a later step. 
Ground the cases of X3 and X4. The ground pads are to the left of 
the crystals.  
Install the 4.9136 MHz filter crystals at X5 through X11. 
Ground the cases of X5 and X6. The ground pads are near where 
the two crystals meet.  
A special grounding technique is required for X7-X11. There 
are two ground pads for each of these crystals, one on either side. Use 
bare wires (10 total) for grounding the crystals as you did in previous 
steps, but do not solder the wires to the tops of the crystals. The wires 
must be soldered to the sides of the crystals, instead, about 1/4" (6 
mm) up from the surface of the PC board.  
Be very careful not to overheat the crystals. Use a temperature-
controlled iron, and limit soldering time to about 3 seconds per 
soldering attempt. 
i
  In the following steps you’ll install several toroidal  inductors. 
Use the number of turns indicated. Do not attempt to alter the turns 
to match inductances specified in the parts list. 
Sort the black and dark gray toroidal cores into three groups to 
avoid mis-identifying them in later steps. You should have eight FT37-
43 ferrite cores (3/8", 9.5 mm); four T44-10 iron powder cores (0.44", 
11 mm); and one FT50-43 ferrite core (0.5", 12.7 mm). Ferrite cores 
are dark gray; T44-10 cores are black. 
Locate a 3/8" (9.5 mm) diameter ferrite toroidal core (type FT37-
43) as described above.

Find RFC14’s component outline on the RF board, near the front 
left-hand corner. Compare this component outline to Figure 6-15, 
which shows two views of a typical toroidal inductor. RFC14 will be 
mounted vertically as shown at the right side of the drawing, with one 
wire exiting at the core’s upper left, and the other at the lower right. 
There are pads on the PC board in these two locations. 
Remove insulation 
 
Figure 6-15 
Note: Toroid illustrations such as the one above do not always 
show the actual number of turns used. 
To wind RFC14, cut a 9" (23 cm) length of  #26 red enamel-
coated wire, then "sew" the long end of the wire through the core 
exactly 10 times. Each pass through the core counts as one turn. The 
finished winding should look very similar to Figure 6-15, but with 10 
turns rather than 14. 
 Verify that the turns of RFC14 are not bunched together. They 
should be evenly-spaced and occupy about 85% of the core’s 
circumference. If the turns are all bunched together, RFC14’s 
inductance value will not be correct. (Unless otherwise specified, 
about 80 to 90% of the core should always be used.) 
 
Stripping Toroid Leads 
The enamel wire supplied with the kit can be heat-stripped. One way 
to do this is to place a small amount of solder (a "blob") on the end of 
your soldering iron, then insert the wire into the hot solder for a few 
seconds. Another possibility is to burn the insulation off by heating it 
with a match or small butane lighter for a few seconds, then use fine-
grain sandpaper to remove the enamel residue. Avoid scraping 
insulation off with a razor blade, as this may nick the wire. 
 Strip and tin the leads of the toroid before you mount it on the 
board. As shown in Figure 6-15, you should remove the enamel from 
the leads up to about 1/8" (3 mm) from the core. You should see only 
bare wire (no insulation) on the side to be soldered. 
 Install RFC14 vertically as shown by its component outline, near 
the front left-hand corner of the board, then pull the leads taut on the 
bottom of the board.  
 Solder the leads of RFC14. When soldering, make sure that the 
solder binds well to the leads. If the lead appears to be an "island" in a 
small pool of solder, chances are it is not making good contact. 
Measure from pad to pad (not wire to wire) using an ohmmeter to be 
sure the leads are making contact. 
i
  Do not use adhesives or fixatives of any kind to secure 
toroids to the PC board. Toroids will be adequately held to the board 
by their leads alone. (T5 is the only exception.)

 RFC16 is wound on an FT37-43 core (dark gray) using 16 turns 
of red enamel wire (12", 30 cm). Wind this inductor in the same 
manner as RFC14. Install RFC16 vertically, to the right of RFC14. 
 RFC11 is wound on an FT37-43 core using 20 turns of red 
enamel wire (16", 40 cm). Wind this inductor and prepare its leads in 
the same manner as RFC14. 
 Install RFC11 horizontally, on the bottom side of the board, as 
shown by its component outline (near the center of the board). The 
pads for RFC11 are the two that just touch the outline. Pull the leads 
taut on the top to keep the toroid secured to the board, then solder. 
i
  T5 is a toroidal transformer, with two numbered windings. 
These numbers are printed next to each pad on the PC board. T5’s 
windings are 1–2 and 3–4. 
 Locate the large yellow core (T50-6) for use at T5. The core is 
1/2" (12.7 mm) in diameter. 
 Wind the first winding, 1-2, using 16 turns of  red enamel wire 
(15", 38 cm). This winding must occupy 85% of the core, and will 
look very similar to Figure 6-15. Remember that each pass through the 
core counts as one turn. 
 Carefully strip and tin the leads of T5’s 1-2 winding. 
 T5’s other winding, 3–4, uses 4 turns of  green enamel wire (7", 
18 cm). Wind the 3–4 winding on top of the 1–2 winding, interleaving 
the turns as shown in Figure 6-16. The turns should be secure, not 
loose. Strip and tin the leads of the 3–4 winding. 
 
Note: T5’s 3–4 winding must be wound exactly as illustrated or the 
VFO will not function correctly.

mm) diameter nylon washer, 1/2" (12.7 mm) long nylon 4-40 screw, 
and a #4 nylon nut. Tighten the nylon nut just enough to hold the 
assembly in place. Do not over-tighten as this will strip the threads.

 Transformer T6 is mounted vertically, near the middle of the 
board. It uses a different winding technique where the wires for the 
two windings are twisted together before winding ("bi-filar"). Cut  two 
12" (30 cm) lengths of enamel wire, one red and one green. Twist 
them together over their entire length. The wires should cross over 
each other about once every 1/2" or 12 mm. 
 Wind the twisted wires onto a 3/8" (9.5 mm) ferrite core (FT37-
43), using exactly 10 turns. Use the same method you used when 
winding non-twisted wires, covering about 85% of the core. Figure 
6-19 shows how the winding should look from two views (your turns 
count will be 10 rather than 8 as in the drawing).

  The BFO toroid, L33, is supplied pre-wound due to the 
large number of turns and very small gauge wire required. When 
handling L33, be very careful not to damage the leads.  
 Locate the rubber stem bumper. Clip off about one-half of the tip 
of the stem using diagonal cutters. 
 L33 is located on the bottom of the board, near the front center. 
Place the rubber stem bumper directly on top of L33's component 
outline. Flush-trim the leads of all parts under or near L33 so the 
stem bumper can sit flat on the PC board. 
 Locate the pre-wound BFO inductor, L33 (41 µH, 5%). It may be 
supplied in a small envelope or bag labeled "L33".  
 Press L33 down onto the stem bumper as far as it will go. 
Position L33 and the stem bumper as shown in Figure 6-20. 
 Locate resistor R116 (1/8th watt, 5.1 megohm, green-brown-
green). Bend the leads of R116 down at 90-degree angles to match the 
spacing of L33's pads (Figure 6-20).

 Insert R116's leads into L33's pads, then press the resistor down 
directly on top of L33. The resistor's body should be partially recessed 
into the "well" left in the center of the toroid (Figure 6-21). 
 Use the leads of R116 to hold L33 firmly to the board (Figure 
6-21), bending them outward on the top side. Solder R116. 
 
 
Figure 6-21 
 Solder L33's leads to the leads of the resistor points as shown in 
Figure 6-22. Keep L33's leads as short as possible, and away from any 
nearby component pads. 
 Trim off the excess portion of L33's leads. Note: Trimming fine 
wire may be difficult with worn or poor-quality diagonal cutters. Be 
careful not to stress L33's leads in the process. Use a magnifying glass 
if necessary. 
 
 
Figure 6-22 
 To ensure that R116 cannot short to the bottom cover, attach a 
thin self-adhesive insulator to the bottom cover in the area directly 
beneath L33. Electrical or other types of tape may be used.

  D40 and D41 were added to the receiver I.F. circuit to prevent 
saturation when a station a few feet away transmits on your frequency. 
These diodes will be installed in the steps below.  
 On the bottom of the RF board, locate resistor R114, which is 
near the power switch. Near R114 you'll find the 8 pads for I.F  amp 
U12, which is on the top side of the board (Figure 6-23). 
 Solder 1N4148 diodes D40 and D41 to the two round pads just to 
the right of R114 (pads #3 and #4 of T7, which is on the top side). The 
banded ends of the diodes go in opposite directions.

Visual Inspection 
 Examine the bottom side of the RF board carefully for unsoldered 
pins, solder bridges, or cold solder joints. Since this is a large board, 
you should break the examination up into three parts: 
 
__ perimeter of the board 
__ front half 
__ back half   
 
 Examine the top side in the same manner. 
 Set S1 on the RF board to OFF position. (Plunger OUT).

Alignment and Test, Part II 
 
In this section you’ll test and align the PLL (phase-locked-loop) 
synthesizer and receiver circuits. Once this is completed you’ll be able 
to test the receiver using all modes on 40 meters. 
 Connect your power supply or battery and turn on the K2.  
 
4 MHz Oscillator Calibration 
 Plug the frequency counter probe into P6 (Control board).  
 Connect the probe tip to the PLL reference oscillator test point, 
TP3 (left-front corner of the RF board, near U4). 
 Using the menu, select CAL FCTR, then hold 
EDIT a second time to enable the frequency counter. The counter 
should show a frequency of 12090 kHz +/- 30 kHz. If it is 0000.00, 
changing rapidly, or out of range, you could have a problem with the 
counter probe or the PLL Reference Oscillator. 
 Use one of the following methods to adjust C22 on the Control 
board (listed in order of preference): 
 
 
Connect a calibrated external frequency counter probe to TP3, 
without removing the K2's internal counter probe. Adjust C22 
until the K2's reading matches the external counter's reading. 
 
Alternatively, you can use a calibrated short-wave or ham-band 
receiver. Set the receiver for LSB or USB mode. Connect a short 
length of wire to the receiver's antenna jack, and lay the end near 
the 4 MHz crystal on the K2 Control board. Find the oscillator 
signal on the receiver. Tune the receiver to 4.000 MHz, and adjust 
C22 until you hear a zero-beat (pitch = 0 Hz). 
 
If you don't have a counter or receiver, leave C22 set at its mid-
point for now. You can improve the calibration later using a 
calibrated signal generator or an on-air signal, such as WWV (at 
10.000 MHz). 
 PLL Reference Oscillator Range Test 
 Set up the K2 internal counter as described for 4 MHz Oscillator 
Calibration (at left, first three steps). 
 If you have an external frequency counter probe connected to 
TP3 along with the K2's internal counter probe, disconnect it. 
 When you’re in frequency counter mode, the BAND+ and 
BAND- switches can be used to check the range of the PLL reference 
oscillator. First, tap BAND+ and write down the frequency reading 
below (typically about 12100 kHz). Then tap BAND- and write down 
this frequency reading (typically 12080-12090 kHz). 
 
Ref. High Freq.  
Ref. Low Freq.  
Range (kHz) 
____________ ____________ __________ 
 Subtract the lower frequency reading from the higher reading. 
The range must be between 9.8 and 15 kHz (if not, see 
Troubleshooting). Tap MENU to exit CAL FCTR. 
 
VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) Test 
 Use BAND+ or BAND- to select the 80-meter band, and set the 
VFO for a frequency of about 4000.10 kHz. 
 Connect the frequency counter probe to the VCO test point, TP1. 
Activate the frequency counter using CAL FCTR as before. 
 You should now see a frequency counter reading in the 8 to 10 
MHz range. It may or may not be stable at this time (i.e., the frequency 
may be changing). If the reading is 0000 kHz or is changing rapidly, 
you probably don’t have the counter cable connected to the VCO test 
point. If the reading is fairly stable but not between 8 and 10 MHz, 
refer to Troubleshooting. 
 Tap MENU to exit CAL FCTR.

    ELECRAFT® 
VCO Alignment 
In the following steps you’ll adjust the VCO inductor (L30) so that the 
VCO control voltage is in the proper range.  
 Disconnect the internal frequency counter probe and remove it 
completely from the K2. 
 Select 80 meters, and set the VFO for about 4000 kHz. 
 Connect a DMM (digital multimeter) to the left end of resistor 
R30 (near the center of the synthesizer area of the RF board) and 
ground. Use a small alligator clip to ensure a good connection. (You 
can also use the built-in voltmeter to measure the VCO control 
voltage. Refer to Voltmeter Probe Assembly in Part I.) 
 It is possible to damage the slugs in slug-tuned inductors if 
you use a metal tool or if you tune the slug too far in or out. The 
tuning tool provided will not damage the slugs. 
 Using the wide end of the plastic tuning tool, adjust the slug in 
inductor L30 until the voltage at R30 reads 6.0 V. If the voltmeter 
reading does not change at all as you tune L30 through its full range, 
refer to Troubleshooting. If the voltage changes but you cannot get to 
6.0 V, you have probably wound the VCO inductor (T5) incorrectly or 
have installed the wrong value at L30 or C72. 
 Set the VFO for approximately 3500 kHz. 
 Measure and write down the VCO control voltage at this 
frequency in Table 6-1 (using pencil). 
 For each remaining band, set the VFO to the low and high 
frequencies listed in Table 6-1 and write down the VCO control 
voltages.9 (You can tune quickly to the approximate frequencies in the 
table by selecting the 1-kHz tuning rate.) 
                                                     
9 Usable VFO coverage extends well beyond the ranges given in the table. 15 MHz is 
used as the upper boundary on 20 meters to allow reception of WWV at this 
frequency.

 If some VCO control voltage readings above are < 1.5 V, or 
some of them are > 7.5 V, you may be able to shift the entire set of 
readings so that they are all within the 1.5 to 7.5 V range. Switch to 
the band (and frequency) that had the highest or lowest voltage, then 
adjust L30 to bring that reading into range. Then re-measure all of the 
voltages to make sure they're in range. 
i
 If you have some voltages that are < 1.5 V and others that are 
> 7.5 V, you have probably installed the wrong value at one or more of 
the VCO capacitors (C71-C74) or varactor diodes (D21-D26). Another 
possibility is that T5 has the wrong number of turns or that you 
installed the wrong type of slug-tuned inductor at L30. If you change 
any of these components, repeat the VCO alignment procedure. 
 Disconnect the DMM from R30. 
 Connect the internal frequency counter probe to the BFO test 
point, TP2 (right side of the RF board, near the crystal filter).

BFO Test 
 
The BFO (beat-frequency oscillator) will be tested in the following 
steps. 
 Switch to the 40-m band. 
 Connect the frequency counter to the BFO test point (TP2), 
which is on the right side of the RF board near the crystal filter. 
 Using the menu, select CAL FCTR. The counter should show a 
frequency between 4908 and 4918 kHz.  
i
  If you see a reading of 0000.00 kHz, or one that is changing 
rapidly, you may not have the frequency counter probe connected 
properly, or the BFO may not be working (see Troubleshooting). If 
you see a stable frequency reading that is nowhere near 4908-4918 
kHz, you may have installed the wrong crystals in the BFO (X3/X4).  
 When you’re in frequency counter mode, the BAND+ and 
BAND- switches can be used to check the range of the BFO. First, tap 
BAND+ and write down the frequency reading below (typically about 
4916-4917 kHz). Then tap BAND- and write down this frequency 
reading (usually about 4909-4912 kHz). Finally, calculate the BFO 
range (high - low) in kHz. Typical range is 4 to 6 kHz. 
 
BFO High Freq. ___________ (must be >= 4916.3 kHz) 
 
BFO Low Freq.  
___________  (must be <= 4912.7 kHz) 
 
Range (High - Low) 
___________  (must be >= 3.6 kHz) 
 
 
 
If your BFO range is less than 3.6 kHz,  you may have the wrong 
varactor diodes installed at D37 or D38, or the wrong crystals installed 
at X3 or X4.  
 
If the BFO frequencies are shifted too high or too low, it may be due 
to one of the following: 
 
 
If you didn't calibrate the K2's internal frequency counter using an 
external counter, it may not be reading accurately. If possible, 
borrow an accurate counter and re-do the 4 MHz Oscillator 
Calibration.  
 
The BFO range shift could be due to the inductance of L33 being 
too high or too low. However, since L33 is supplied pre-wound 
and tested, this is unlikely.  
 
The leads of R116 may have been heated excessively during 
soldering, shorting out a portion of L33's turns. 
 
One of L33's leads could be broken. Look closely at the leads 
using a magnifying glass. 
 
One or more of the capacitors or varactor diodes in the BFO 
circuit could be of the wrong value.

BFO Alignment 
 
The K2 uses a variable-bandwidth crystal filter, allowing the operator 
to set up as many as four filter bandwidths for each operating mode. 
Each of these filter configurations requires an appropriate BFO setting, 
which determines the pitch you hear.  
 
Filter and BFO set up is done with the CAL FIL calibration function. 
CAL FIL is described in detail in the Operation section of the 
manual, under Calibration Functions. Rather than duplicate this 
information here, we'll refer you to the instructions and example in the 
Operation section. 
 Make sure the bottom cover is securely attached. 
 Tap PRE/ATT until the PRE annunciator is turned on. (Turning 
the preamp on will provide some background noise so you can hear 
the effect of changing filter bandwidths.) 
 Follow all instructions on page 91 to become familiar with the 
CAL FIL function. 
 Perform the steps in the example on page 93 to set up all filters. 
You'll use the filter and BFO data from Table 8-1 (for a CW-only K2), 
since the SSB adapter is not installed. If you later install the SSB 
adapter, you can easily change the settings to take advantage of the 
optimized, fixed-bandwidth SSB filter. 
 
 
VFO Linearization 
 Make sure the bottom cover is securely attached.  
 Allow the K2 to stabilize for at least 10 minutes at room 
temperature (approx. 20-25C). (Note: Avoid using a high-wattage 
work lamp direct above the K2 during calibration. With the top cover 
removed, this could heat the RF board to a higher  temperature than 
would ever be seen during normal operation.) 
 Connect the internal frequency counter cable to the VCO output 
test point (TP1). 
 Use the procedure listed below to linearize the VFO. If you see 
any INFO messages, refer to Troubleshooting. 
 
1. Use BAND+ or BAND- to select 40 meters. Select CW normal 
mode and filter FL1. 
2. Set the VFO to anywhere in the range 7000-7100 kHz. 
3. Enter the menu and select CAL PLL, then hold EDIT a second 
time to start the VFO linearization sequence.  
4. The frequency counter will show the VCO frequency as it 
decreases through a range of about 10-13 kHz. (The letter "d" will 
flash each time a calibration data point is stored.) 
5. When calibration is completed (4-8 minutes), you'll see the 
message End on the LCD. You can then tap any switch to return 
to normal operation. If you see an INFO message rather than 
End, refer to Troubleshooting (Appendix E).

I.F. Amplifier Alignment 
 
L34, located near the right front corner of the RF board, is used to 
peak the output of the I.F. amplifier. 
 Using the wide end of the plastic tuning tool, adjust the slug in 
L34 until it is near the top of the can. Stop turning the slug when it 
appears to be at the top or when you feel resistance. 
 Turn L34’s slug one full turn clockwise (down into the can).  
 Set the band to 40 meters using BAND+ or BAND-. Select CW 
Normal and FL2 (700 Hz nominal bandwidth). 
 Make sure the RF GAIN control is fully clockwise (max. gain). 
Disconnect the antenna from J4, if one was connected. 
 Tap PRE/ATTN until the PRE annunciator turns on. 
 Connect a pair of headphones (stereo or mono) to the front panel 
jack, and turn the AF GAIN control to about midway. 
 Slowly tune the VFO to locate the weak internally-generated 
signal near 7000 kHz. If you can't hear the signal at all, you may have 
a receiver problem. Try the 40-meter Band Pass Filter Alignment, 
below, then refer to Troubleshooting if necessary. 
 While listening to the signal at 7000 kHz, adjust L34 for best 
signal strength and lowest noise. This setting occurs at about 1 to 1.5 
turns below the top of the can. (You can use your DMM on AC volts, 
at the speaker jack, to obtain a more sensitive indication.) 
 
40-Meter Band Pass Filter Alignment 
 Connect an antenna or a signal generator to the antenna jack on 
the rear panel. If you use a signal generator, set it for approx. 7150 
kHz at an output level of about -100 dBm, or strong enough to activate 
the S-meter. If you're using an antenna, tune in a signal in the range of 
7100-7200 kHz. If you cannot find a signal, you can use atmospheric 
noise from the antenna to peak the filter. 
 Using the plastic tuning tool, adjust both L1 and L2 (back left 
corner) for peak signal strength. You may be able to use the bargraph 
if the signal is strong enough. If  you do not hear any signals or noise, 
see Troubleshooting. 
i
 In CW mode, the frequency shown on the display takes into 
account an offset equal to your sidetone pitch. This allows you to 
determine a station's actual carrier frequency by matching their pitch 
to your sidetone, rather than by zero-beating the signal. The SPOT 
switch can be used for this purpose. 
 
This completes 40-meter receiver alignment. You may wish to become 
familiar with the K2’s receiver features before proceeding (see 
Operation). In Part III you’ll install the remaining band-pass filters and 
align the transmitter and receiver on all bands. 
 
Assembly, Part III 
 
In this final RF board assembly section you’ll install the transmitter 
components, as well as the remaining band-pass and low-pass filters. 
This will allow you to align and test the K2 on all bands. 
 Turn off the K2 and disconnect the power supply. 
 Remove the two screws holding the Front Panel board to the 
Control board, then unplug the Control board. Use the long-handled 
Allen wrench as described in Part I.  
 Remove the bottom cover. 
 Remove the screws from the front panel assembly and unplug it 
from the RF board.  
 Remove the side panels by taking out the two screws along the 
bottom edge of each panel.

 Ferrite-bead assemblies Z1 and Z2 will be installed vertically 
near transformer T3 as indicated by their component outlines. To make 
these assemblies, string two ferrite beads onto a 1" (25 mm) length of 
bare hookup wire (or discarded component leads) as shown in Figure 
6-24. 
 
 
 
Figure 6-24 
 Install Z1 and Z2, bending the leads on the bottom of the board to 
hold them in place. Make sure that the beads are seated flat against the 
PC board, then solder. 
 Locate D9, the 1N5711 diode which you identified and set aside 
earlier. Install D9 near the right edge of the board. 
 Install electrolytic capacitors C126 (47 µF) and C137 (100 µF), 
Near the "ELECRAFT" label at the center of the board. Insert the (+) 
lead of each capacitor into the hole marked (+). 
 Install electrolytic capacitor C125 (22 µF) which is near U1. 
 Install Q5 (2N5109). Be sure Q5 is firmly seated on the board 
and has its tab oriented as shown by the component outline before 
soldering.  
 Install the following components on the bottom of the board, 
working from left to right.

  TO-220 package transistors Q6, 7, and 8 look identical, but 
Q6 is different. Locate the two 2SC1969’s (labeled "C1969"), Q7 and 
Q8, and set them to one side. The remaining transistor, Q6, will be 
either a 2SC2166 (C2166) or a 2SC5739 (C5739). This transistor will 
be installed first. 
 Attach a self-adhesive thermal pad to the PC board on top of the 
component outline for Q6. The hole in the thermal pad must be aligned 
precisely with Q6's mounting hole on the board. 
 Prepare the leads of Q6 as you did with the voltage regulators on 
the Control board (Figure 4-4, page 17), using gradual bends to avoid 
lead breakage. Insert Q6 as shown by its component outline. 
 Secure Q6 to the board using a 4-40 x 3/8" (9.5 mm) screw, #4 
lock washer and 4-40 nut. The screw should be inserted from the 
bottom side of the RF board; the washer and nut go on the top. 
 Verify that the body of Q6 is not touching the leads of any 
adjacent components, then solder. 
 Wind and install each of the low-pass filter inductors listed 
below, starting at the back-right with L16 and L17 (80 meters). Wind 
each of the toroids using the core type and number of turns indicated 
(use red  enamel wire). Review the toroid winding instructions and 
illustrations for RFC14 (Page 55).

  It is very important to wind and install toroidal transformers 
T1 through T4 exactly as described in the following steps. Remember 
that transformer windings are identified by numbered pairs of leads, 
which correspond to the PC board and schematic.  
 T1 is wound on an FT37-43 ferrite core (dark gray) and has 
windings similar to those shown in Figure 6-25. The 1–2 winding is 9 
turns of red enamel wire (10", 25 cm). The 3–4 winding is 3 turns of 
green enamel wire (5", 13 cm). (The drawing shows more than 9 turns 
on the larger winding.) 
 Prepare T1’s leads as in Part II. Completely remove the 
insulation to within about 1/8" (3 mm) of the core, then tin the leads.

 T2 is wound on the same core type as T1 (FT37-43). Its windings 
must be spaced as shown in Figure 6-26(a), with the 3-4 winding 
occupying about half the diameter of the core. T2’s 1–2 winding is 12 
turns of red enamel wire (13", 33 cm), and its 3–4 winding is 8 turns 
of green (9", 23 cm).  
 Prepare T2’s leads, but leave an extra 1/2" of insulation on leads 
3 and 4 (green) as shown in Figure 6-26(a). 
 Fold the leads of T2's green winding (3-4) down and under the 
core as shown in Figure 6-26(b). 
 Install T2 horizontally, just to the right of Q6. To ensure that the 
leads do not contact any adjacent pads or components, T2 should be 
mounted so that it is elevated slightly above the board (about 1/16" 
[1.5 mm]).

Figure 6-26 
 Transformer T3 is mounted vertically, to the right of T2. The 
wires for the two windings must be twisted together before winding 
(bi-filar). First, cut two 10" (25 cm) lengths of enamel wire, one red, 
and one green. Then twist the wires together over their entire length. 
The wires should cross each other once every 1/2" or 1 cm. 
 Wind the twisted wires onto a 1/2" (12.7 mm) dia. ferrite core 
(FT50-43), using exactly 5 turns and covering about 85% of the core. 
Figure 6-27 shows how the winding should look. The leads of T3 are 
labeled with letters A through D on the PC board to avoid confusing 
them with the numbered leads of T2 and T4. 
 Separate T3’s leads as shown in Figure 6-27. Strip and tin the 
leads, being careful not to let the red/green wire pairs short together. 
 Install T3 vertically as shown by its component outline. T3 must 
be seated flat against the PC board, with its leads pulled tight on the 
bottom side.

 Locate the "binocular" (2-hole) ferrite core for T4. Wind 2 turns 
of green-insulated hookup wire (5", 13 cm) through the core as 
shown in Figure 6-28. This forms the 1–2 winding. (Do not use 
enamel-coated wire.)

Figure 6-29 
 Before installing T4, verify that the screws holding the 2-D 
fastener beneath it are tightened, and that #4 internal-tooth lock 
washers were used. It is important that these screws not come loose 
sometime after T4 has been installed. 
 Install T4 to the right of T3, inserting leads for the 1–2 and 3–4 
windings into their matching numbered holes. T4 should rest directly 
on top of the screws that secure the 2-D fastener beneath it. T4 should 
also be parallel to the board, not tilted to one side. Pull the leads taut 
on the bottom and bend them to hold the transformer in place. Do not 
solder T4 yet. 
 Use two 2" (5 cm) lengths of bare hookup wire to form the 5–6 
and 7–8 windings on T4 (Figure 6-30). (These are more accurately 
described as links, each being just a single turn.) Route the bare wires 
through the core first, then bend them down and insert them into their 
numbered holes. Do not solder yet.

  PA transistors Q7 and Q8 (2SC1969) must be installed on the 
bottom of the PC board, with their metal tabs facing away from the 
board, as explained in the following steps. Locate the component 
outlines on the bottom of the board before proceeding. 
 Prepare the leads of Q7 as shown in Figure 6-31. Bend the leads 
upward, away from the tab--the opposite of the way you bent the leads 
of Q6. Form the leads using the shaft of a small screwdriver to create 
gradual bends. Do not install Q7 yet. 
 
 
Figure 6-31 
 Insert a 4-40 x 1/2" (12.7 mm) screw through the PC board hole 
for Q7’s tab (see Figure 6-31). Then slip the hardware listed below 
onto this mounting screw from the bottom side.  (The shoulder washer 
can be found with the MISCELLANEOUS components.) 
 
__ #4 fibre washer (black) 
__ 1/4" (6.4 mm) dia., 1/8" (3 mm) long phenolic standoff (brown) 
__ #4 nylon shoulder washer (black) 
i
  Do not use any hardware other than that supplied. The height 
of the PA transistor assembly is critical for maintaining good heat 
dissipation. 
 
 Place Q7 on the bottom of the board so that the leads are inserted 
into the PC board as indicated by Q7’s component outline. The 
mounting screw and hardware should appear as shown in Figure 6-31. 
Do not solder yet. 
 Make sure the smaller part of the shoulder washer is visible 
through the hole in Q7’s metal tab. 
 Secure Q7 and its hardware temporarily using a 4-40 nut and #4 
lock washer. Tighten the nut only finger-tight. 
 Once Q7 and its hardware appears to be parallel to the PC board 
as shown in Figure 6-31, solder Q7 on the top of the board. 
 Repeat the steps above for the other PA transistor, Q8.  
 
Uninstalled Components 
Check off the components in the list below, verifying that they are 
not yet installed. All of these components are on the top side of the

  If you have already purchased option kits, you may install 
selected option components now, as explained in the following steps. 
This will simplify installation of the options after K2 alignment and 
test have been completed. 
 
Do not remove the option bypass jumpers (W1, W2, etc.). The K2 
must be aligned and tested before the jumpers are removed and  
option modules installed.  
 
K160RX Component Installation (optional) 
 Locate the Installation section of the K160RX kit manual. 
 Cross out the first three steps (turning off the K2, removing 
hardware, etc.), which are not applicable since the K2 is already 
disassembled. Skip the next two steps. Do not remove W1. 
 Complete the steps for J14 through C13 and C14. 
 Cross out the next two steps (examination of Q7 and Q8). The 
remaining steps should be completed after K2 alignment. 
 
KSB2 Component Installation (optional) 
 Locate KSB2 Module Installation in the KSB2 manual. 
 Complete only the steps required to install J11, J9, and J10, and 
the standoff. Do not remove W2, W3, or C167 at this time. 
Complete the remaining steps after alignment. 
 
Other Option Component Installation (optional) 
 If you have the KAT2 (ATU) or KPA100 (Amplifier) option, 
install 2-pin connector P6. Use the option manual's instructions. 
 If you have the KBT2 (Battery) or KPA100 option, install  
2-pin connector P3. Use the option manual's instructions. 
 If you have the KNB2 (Noise Blanker) option, locate the 
Installation section of the KNB2 manual. Complete only the 
installation of J12 and the standoff. Do not remove W5, R88, R89 or 
R90 at this time. 
i
  Do not attempt to pre-install parts supplied with the 
K60XV option. The K2 must be completed and tested first.  
 
Visual Inspection 
 Examine the bottom (solder side) of the RF board carefully for 
unsoldered pins, solder bridges, or cold solder joints. Since this is a 
large board, you should break the examination up into three parts: 
__ perimeter area 
__ front half 
 
__ back half   
 Examine the top (component side) of the RF board for unsoldered 
pins, solder bridges, or cold solder joints. This step is necessary 
because some components are installed on the bottom of the board and 
soldered on top. 
 Make sure switch S1 on the RF board is in the OFF position. 
(Plunger OUT is OFF.)

 Install the two side panels and secure with two chassis screws 
each as you did in Part I and Part II.  
 Plug in the front panel assembly and make sure the connectors 
are completely mated. Secure the front panel with four chassis screws. 
 Verify that all components on the bottom of the RF board have an 
installed height of 1/4" (6 mm) or less. Capacitors that stand above this 
height must be bent downward so that they won’t hit the bottom cover 
or heat sink. 
 Install the bottom cover and secure it using six chassis screws.  
 Plug in the Control board. Make sure that all three connectors are 
completely mated. 
 Secure the front panel and Control boards together using two  
chassis screws. 
 Locate the heat sink panel. You'll need to remove all of the 
masking tape from this panel except that covering the "RCV ANT" 
and "XVTR IN/OUT" holes. Use a sharp tool to cut though the tape, 
leaving a 1/2" (12 mm) border around these holes. Then peel the tape 
off, leaving these holes covered. 
 Attach two round rubber feet to the heat sink using 4-40 x 7/16" 
(11 mm) screws, #4 lock washers, and 4-40 nuts. The screws are 
standard steel/zinc-plated, not black anodized. The nuts go on the 
inside surface of the heat sink. (The rubber feet can be found with the 
MISCELLANEOUS items.) 
 Remove the finishing nuts and washers from the shafts of the 
antenna and key jacks. They will be re-installed later. 
 Turn the K2 up on its left side. This will keep the PA transistor 
screws from slipping out during the following steps. 
 
 Remove the 4-40 nuts and #4 lock washers from the mounting 
screws for Q7 and Q8, but do not pull the screws out. (If you pull these 
screws out, the associated hardware will fall off and will have to be re-
installed.)  
i
  In the next step you'll install thermal insulation pads on the 
power amplifier transistors, Q7 and Q8. These pads must be positioned 
correctly to keep the collectors of the transistors from shorting to 
ground. Proper positioning is also required to guarantee good heat 
conduction. 
 Place self-adhesive thermal pads on top of Q7 and Q8 as shown 
in Figure 6-32, with the hole in the pad centered over the hole in the 
transistor tab. The adhesive side must be in contact with the transistor.

 Back out the mounting screws for Q7 and Q8 until the ends of the 
screws protrude only slightly from the transistor tabs. Keep the K2 on 
its left side so the screws don’t slip out further. 
 Make sure that the thermal pads on Q7 and Q8 are centered, and 
that you can see the shoulder washers inside the tab holes. If the 
shoulder washers have come out of the tab holes, re-align the PA 
transistor hardware as needed.

 Keeping the K2 on its left side, slip the heat sink over the rear-
panel connectors and into position (Figure 6-33). Figure 6-34 shows 
how the heat sink and associated hardware appear in cross-section. 
 
 
 
Figure 6-33 
 
 Make sure that the four small holes in the heat sink line up with 
Q7/Q8 and the 2-D block between them. 
 Press the Q7/Q8 mounting screws all the way back in so that they 
protrude from the heat sink. 
 Use two chassis screws and two #4 lock washers to secure the 
heat sink firmly to the 2-D fastener. 
 Secure Q7 and Q8 on the bottom of the heat sink using 4-40 nuts 
and #4 lock washers. Do not over-tighten the nuts, as this may cause 
the thermal pads to scrape against the heat sink, possibly causing a 
short to ground. 
 
 
Figure 6-34 
 Using an ohmmeter on a low resistance scale, check for a short 
from Q7 or Q8 collector to ground. (This test should also be performed 
any time the heat sink is removed and re-installed.)  If a short is 
measured, remove the heat sink and investigate the cause. The most 
likely reason for a short is mis-alignment of a shoulder washer or 
thermal pad. If a thermal pad or shoulder washer is damaged, it must 
be replaced. 
 There are four more #4 holes in the heat sink:  two on the bottom 
and two on the back panel. Use four chassis screws to secure the heat 
sink to the side panels and RF board at these locations. You may need 
to adjust the positions of the 2-D fasteners on the side panels slightly. 
 Install the washers and finishing nuts that you removed earlier 
from the antenna and key jacks. (The antenna jack hardware is shown 
installed in Figure 6-34.)

Alignment and Test, Part III 
 
In this section you’ll complete alignment and test of the K2 on all 
bands.  
 Make sure the power switch, S1, is in the OFF position (out). 
 Connect your power supply or battery. For transmitter tests, a 
battery or well-regulated power supply that can handle at least 2 amps 
is recommended. Avoid using a switching power supply unless it is 
well shielded and includes EMI filtering. A linear-mode supply will 
typically generate much less noise in the HF bands. (See any recent 
ARRL Handbook for examples of both types.) 
 Connect a 50-ohm dummy load such as the Elecraft DL1 to the 
antenna jack. The dummy load should be rated at 10 watts or higher. 
(The DL1 is rated at 20 watts.) 
 Connect a pair of headphones and a key or keyer paddle. 
 Set the POWER control fully counter-clockwise (minimum 
power output). 
 Turn on the K2. You should see ELECRAFT on the LCD, 
followed by the frequency display.  
 Select voltage/current display mode by tapping DISPLAY to 
make sure the receiver is not drawing excess current. (Typical current 
drain will be 180-250 mA depending on menu settings.)    
 Return to frequency display mode. 
 Switch to CW and select FL1 using XFIL. 
 Use the menu to set up the desired CW sidetone volume and pitch 
if you have not already done so, using ST L and ST P. The pitch can 
be set from 400 to 800 Hz, although 500-600 Hz is recommended. The 
sidetone volume and tone will vary a small amount as the pitch is 
changed, but it should have a pleasant sinewave sound at any setting. 
 Set up the desired keying device using INP. If you’re using a 
hand key or external keyer, use INP HAND. To use the internal 
keyer, select PDLn or PDLr (normal or reverse paddle). You can 
also connect a computer or external keyer along with the keyer paddle. 
Refer to the Operation section for details on this "auto-detect" feature 
(Page 99). 
 To verify that the sidetone is functioning, hold the 
SPOT switch. Tap any switch to turn the SPOT tone off.

40-Meter Transmitter Alignment 
i
  To align the transmitter you’ll need some means for 
monitoring power output as you adjust the band-pass filters. An analog 
wattmeter or oscilloscope is ideal. However, in the instructions that 
follow we’ll assume that you’re using the K2’s built-in digital 
wattmeter, which will also provide satisfactory results. 
 Set the POWER control for 2.0 watts. 
 Switch to the 40 meter band and set the VFO for about 7100 kHz.  
 Locate the 40-meter band-pass filter inductors, L1 and L2, and be 
prepared to adjust them using the wide end of the tuning tool. 
i
  In the following steps you’ll place the K2 into "TUNE" mode 
by holding TUNE. You should limit key-down periods to about 5 or 10 
seconds during tune-up for safety reasons. If you see or smell smoke 
turn the K2 off and refer to Troubleshooting.  
 
Note: While in tune mode, it is normal to see power drift upward 
several tenths of a watt. You may also see a sudden jump in power 
during alignment. Adjust the POWER control as needed to maintain 
the output between 1 and 2 watts. 
 Put the K2 into tune mode and activate the built-in wattmeter by 
holding TUNE. Using the alignment tool, adjust L1 for maximum 
output. Tap any switch to exit TUNE mode. 
 Enter tune mode again and adjust L2 for maximum output. Tap 
any switch to exit. 
 If necessary, repeat the adjustment of L1 and L2 two or three 
times to be sure that you have the inductors peaked correctly. If you 
cannot get power output to 2.0 watts or higher, see Troubleshooting. 
 Make sure the bar graph is set for DOT mode using the GRPH 
menu entry. 
 Set power output to 5.0 W using the POWER control.  
 Tap DISPLAY to enter voltage/current display mode. When this 
display is selected, you can use TUNE to check your voltage and 
current in transmit mode. 
 Enter tune mode and note the change in voltage and current. 
Current drain at 5 watts is typically 1.3 to 1.6 amps.10  If the current 
reading is much higher than this, or if the voltage drops more than 1 V, 
you may have a problem in the transmitter, load, or power supply (see 
Troubleshooting). 
 Return to frequency display using the DISPLAY switch. 
 Set the POWER control for 10.0 watts. 
 Enter tune mode just long enough to verify that the wattmeter 
reads approximately 10 watts. If you then switch to voltage/current 
display and hold TUNE again, you should see a current drain of 
typically 1.8 to 2 amps. If you see a "HI CUR" warning message (high 
current), use CAL CUR to set your transmit current limit higher. If 
current is much higher than 2 A, see Troubleshooting. 
 
This completes transmitter alignment and test on 40 meters.  
 
                                                     
10 The K2 transmitter is most efficient at 10 watts and higher; current drain at 
5 watts CW may be higher than expected. This is unavoidable because the K2 
is capable of up to 15 W output. Also, for a given power level, SSB 
transmission requires more transmitter "overhead" to prevent distortion.

Receiver Pre-Alignment 
 
Since the same filters are used on both receive and transmit, it is 
possible to align all the remaining bands on transmit only. However, 
you can pre-align the filters on receive by using a signal or noise 
generator (such as the Elecraft N-Gen), separate ham transceiver, or 
on-air signals and atmospheric noise. This pre-alignment on receive 
will make transmitter alignment easier, since the filter adjustments will 
already be at or close to their final values. 
 Switch to 80 meters and set the VFO for about 3750 kHz (mid-
band). Turn on the RF preamp by tapping PRE/ATTN until you see 
the PRE annunciator turn on. 
 Use a signal generator or an antenna to inject a signal or noise at 
this frequency.  
 Adjust L3 and L4 for maximum signal strength. 
i
  Since some inductors are shared between two bands, you must 
always align the remaining bands in the order indicated. Always use 
this procedure if you re-align the filters later. 
 Switch to 20 meters (14100 kHz) and turn on the preamp. Set 
C21 and C23 to their mid-points. Adjust L8 and L9 for maximum 
signal strength. (This step pre-sets C21, C23, L8, and L9 before final 
adjustment in the next two steps.) 
 Switch to 30 meters (10100 kHz) and turn on the preamp. Adjust 
L8 and L9 for maximum signal strength. 
 Switch back to 20 meters (14100 kHz). Adjust C21 and C23 for 
maximum signal strength. 
 Switch to 15 meters (21100 kHz) and turn on the preamp. Adjust 
L10 and L11 for maximum signal strength. 
 Switch to 17 meters (18100 kHz) and turn on the preamp. Adjust 
C32 and C34 for maximum signal strength. 
 Switch to 10 meters (28200 kHz) and turn on the preamp. Adjust 
L12 and L13 for maximum signal strength. 
 Switch to 12 meters (24900 kHz) and turn on the preamp. Adjust 
C44 and C46 for maximum signal strength. 
 
This completes receiver alignment. 
i
  During receiver alignment, you may have noticed that signal 
strength is somewhat lower in volume when you select the narrowest 
filter (100 Hz setting, FL4). This is because the K2's crystal filter is 
optimized for wider bandwidths (250-800 Hz). Despite the slightly 
greater attenuation, the narrower settings are very useful in reducing 
QRM (interference) from strong, nearby signals. (Any of the filter 
settings can be changed, and FL2-FL4 can even be turned OFF. See 
page 91 for information on customizing filter settings.)

Transmitter Alignment 
 
If you did the receiver alignment, above, you may find that little or no 
transmit adjustment is required on most bands. 
 Set the POWER control for 2.0 watts. 
 Switch to 80 meters and set the VFO for about 3750 kHz (mid-
band). 
 Enter tune mode and adjust L3 and L4 for maximum power as 
indicated on the internal wattmeter. (Use a more sensitive analog 
instrument if available.)  Limit tune-up time to 5 or 10 seconds. 
i
  Since some inductors are shared between two bands, you must 
always align the remaining bands in the order indicated. Always use 
this procedure if you re-align the filters later. 
 Switch to 20 meters (14100 kHz). Set C21 and C23 to their mid-
points. Adjust L8 and L9 for maximum power output. (This step pre-
sets C21, C23, L8, and L9 before final adjustment in the next two 
steps.) 
 Switch to 30 meters (10100 kHz) and adjust L8 and L9 for 
maximum power output. 
 Switch to 20 meters (14100 kHz) and adjust C21 and C23 for 
maximum power output.  
 Switch to 15 meters (21100 kHz) and adjust L10 and L11 for 
maximum power output. 
 Switch to 17 meters (18100 kHz) and adjust C32 and C34 for 
maximum power output. 
 Switch to 10 meters (28200 kHz) and adjust L12 and L13 for 
maximum power output. 
 Switch to 12 meters (24900 kHz) and adjust C44 and C46 for 
maximum power output. 
 
This completes transmitter alignment.

Finishing Touches 
 Examine the Control board one last time to be sure that it is 
correctly plugged into the RF board. All three connectors must be 
mated completely. 
 Leave the frequency counter test cable connected to the BFO test 
point (TP2). This will allow you to modify your filter and BFO 
settings if necessary during normal operation. 
 If there are any missing chassis screws in the bottom cover, heat 
sink, side panels, or front panel, install them now.  
 Plug the internal speaker cable into P5 on the RF board, just 
behind the on-off switch, S1. The connector is keyed and can only be 
plugged in one way.  
i
  Even if you have purchased some K2 options, you should not 
assemble and install them yet. The option manuals assume that you are 
familiar with basic K2 operation. 
 Remove the masking material from the two top-cover mounting 
holes marked C in Figure 7-1. 
 Cut through and peel off about 1/2" x 1/2" (12 x 12 mm) of 
masking material from around the top-cover mounting holes marked D 
in Figure 7-1. These holes are in the far corners of the top cover's rear 
panel, corresponding to screws 1 and 2 in Figure 7-6. 
 Place the top cover onto the chassis and secure it using six 
chassis screws as shown in Figure 7-6.  
i
  When removing the top cover in the future, take out only the 
six screws shown in Figure 7-6. 
 
 
 Attach the self-adhesive serial number label to the rear panel of 
the heat sink in the space provided.  
 Write the serial number on the inside cover of your manual.

  If you did not have access to a frequency counter or calibrated 
receiver when aligning the 4-MHz oscillator, you may wish to use the 
one of the alternative VFO calibration techniques described in the 
Operation section (page 105). You can use an on-air signal, such as 
WWV at 10 MHz, to obtain better than +/- 50 Hz VFO dial calibration 
on all bands.

This section of the manual explains how to set up and operate the 
K2. Refer to the illustrations on the previous pages for control 
locations. A comprehensive "mini-manual" is also available for 
the K2; see our web site for details. 
 
Connections 
Power Supply 
 
You can power the basic K2 (without the KPA100 amplifier) from 
any 9-15 V DC power supply. A mating connector for the DC input 
jack is provided with the kit. Current drain is typically 1.5-2 A on 
transmit, but can be over 3 A at the highest power settings or with 
high SWR. (See Current Limiting, below.) 
Internal Battery:  An optional 12 V, 2.9-Ah rechargeable battery 
can be installed inside the K2 (model KBT2). A 14.0 V power 
supply can then be used to recharge the battery and power the 
transceiver. If an external battery is connected, the internal battery 
must be disabled using the INT BATTERY switch. 
Low Battery Warning: If the supply voltage drops below about 11 
V, you’ll see a brief LO BATT message flashed on the LCD once 
every 8 minutes (approx.). If this happens, reduce power and 
recharge your battery. For tips on battery operation, see page 104. 
Self-Resetting Fuse: If the K2's internal 12 V line is shorted to 
ground, fuse F1 will temporarily open, limiting current drain to about 
100 mA. The display will remain blank. If this happens, turn power 
off until the problem is located and corrected. 
Current Limiting: You can specify the maximum transmit current 
(see CAL CUR, page 90). You'll see HI CUR on the LCD if the 
programmed limit is reached. 
50/60-Hz Interference: Do not place the K2 beside, or on top of, 
any equipment that uses a large AC power transformer. This could 
result in modulation of the K2's low-level signal sources.
Antenna 
A well-matched antenna (50 Ω) or an antenna tuner should be used with 
the K2. Some high SWR conditions may result in excessive current 
drain unless power is reduced. If you have the KAT2 antenna tuner 
option installed, the K2's power control and power output display will 
be much more accurate under all SWR conditions. 
 
Keying Devices 
Any type of hand key, bug, or external keyer can be plugged into the 
KEY jack, or you can use the K2's built-in memory keyer. In all cases, 
you must use a stereo plug with the keying device (a suitable plug is 
provided with the kit). Also see CW Operation (page 99). 
 
Microphone 
A standard 8-pin microphone jack is provided on the front panel. A 
jumper block on the front panel PCB is used to configure the mic jack 
for specific microphones. Refer to the SSB adapter manual. 
 
Headphones 
Any type of mono or stereo headphones at nearly any impedance will 
work with the K2. However, for best results we recommend high-quality 
stereo headphones with full ear covers and 1/8" (3 mm) plug. 
 
External Speaker 
The K2 has a built-in, high-sensitivity 4-ohm speaker. You can also 
plug in an external 4 or 8-ohm speaker at the "EXT. SPKR" jack. 
 
Option Connectors 
A number of mounting holes are provided on the back panel of the K2 
for specific option connectors. See Options (page 117). Two new holes 
were recently added to the lower rear panel to provide more convenient 
low-level transverter I/O. Refer to the K60XV manual.

Controls and Display 
  
LCD and Bargraph Meter 
The LCD shows the operating frequency and other information 
depending on selected display mode. The LED bargraph functions as 
an S-meter on receive, and RF out or ALC meter on transmit. 
 
Power-Up Messages: The LCD will display ELECRAFT for two 
seconds on power-up. If a problem is detected, the display will show 
INFO 100 or a similar message. The number shown corresponds 
to a paragraph in the Troubleshooting section. 
 
Mode Indicator: A letter at the right end of the display tells you the 
operating mode: C (CW), L (LSB), or U (USB). A fourth mode, 
RTTY/data, can also be enabled, and uses the letter r (page 108). If a 
small bar appears above the C or r, it means that the CW sideband 
is inverted (CW reverse or DATA reverse). The mode indicator will 
also flash slowly in two cases: CW TEST mode (see page 100) and 
SPEECH (VOX) mode (see page 102).  
 
Annunciators: The LCD provides eight Chevron-shaped 
annunciators, or status indicators: 
 
NB 
noise blanker on (flashes if Low Threshold setting is 
selected using LEVEL) 
ANT2  
ant. 2 selected (requires ATU) 
PRE 
 
pre-amp on (approx. +14 dB) 
 
ATTN  
attenuator in (-10 dB) 
A 
 
VFO A selected (flashes in SPLIT mode) 
B 
 
VFO B selected (flashes in SPLIT mode)  
RIT 
 
RIT turned on (flashes if wide range selected) 
XIT 
 
XIT turned on (flashes if wide range selected) 
F 
Fast Play CW Message Mode enabled (flashes 
alternately with C) 
 
Decimal Points: The decimal point to the right of the 1 kHz digit 
will flash slowly if the VFO is locked by holding LOCK. See 
Advanced Operating Features for other cases where decimal points flash 
(scanning, page 103; AGC OFF, page 104). 
 
SPLIT/RIT/XIT LED (Optional) 
 
You can install an LED on the front panel that will turn on whenever 
SPLIT, RIT, or XIT is in effect. See the associated application note, 
Adding a SPLIT/RIT/XIT LED to the K2. 
 
Potentiometers 
AF GAIN 
receiver audio level  
RF GAIN 
receiver RF level11 
Turning this control CCW (counter-clockwise) decreases receiver RF 
sensitivity. At the same time it increases the bargraph S-meter 
indication to remind you that you’re not at full receive sensitivity. The 
farther CCW the control is set, the stronger a signal must be before it 
results in a meter deflection. 
KEYER 
keyer speed control 
When you turn this control, keyer speed in words per minute (WPM) 
will be displayed, e.g. SPD 18. The speed can be set from about 9 to 
50 WPM. 
POWER 
power output control 
When you turn this control, power output will be displayed in watts, e.g. 
P 5.0. The range is 0.1 to 15 W for the basic K2, and 1 to  
100 W if you have the KPA100 amplifier installed. See Basic K2 
Operation for details on controlling power output (page 97). 
OFFSET 
RIT/XIT offset  
This control provides a default range of +/- 0.6 kHz in 10 Hz steps when 
RIT and/or XIT are enabled. You can also select a wider RIT/XIT range 
(see RIT menu entry, page 108). 
 
                                                     
11 As in many transceivers, this control actually varies the I.F. gain.

Using the Menu 
 
There are two menus: primary and secondary. You'll use the primary 
menu far more often; see list at right. The secondary menu is 
described starting at page 107. 
To access the menu: Tap MENU. The display will show the menu 
entry last used, with an underline. For example, you might see: LCD  
DAY, indicating that the LCD is in "day" mode (i.e., backlight off). 
You can scroll to a desired menu entry by turning the VFO knob or 
by tapping the BAND+ and BAND- switches.  
To modify a menu entry's parameter: Hold EDIT to move the 
underline to the parameter, rather than the menu entry name. In the 
case of LCD, the parameter can be DAY or NITE. Change the 
parameter using the VFO knob or BAND+ / BAND-. When you’re 
finished, tap MENU to return to scrolling. Another tap of MENU will 
return you to normal operation. 
DISPLAY Switch Usage in EDIT Mode: The DISPLAY switch is 
used to access supplemental parameters when editing certain menu 
entries (marked "*" at right). You will normally not need to change 
these settings. Entries which use DISPLAY include: 
Entry  
DISPLAY Switch Usage in EDIT mode 
ST L 
Selects the sidetone source, U6-25 or U8-4. Use 
U8-4 (default). When using firmware version 
2.04R or later, there are two possible sources (U6-24 
and U8-4). When DISPLAY is tapped in ST P 
menu entry, U8-4 will always be displayed. 
T-R 
Specifies "8R" behavior, 8r hold or 8r nor. 
"Hold" mode (default) holds the 8R line low during 
the user-programmed QSK delay. 
INP 
Selects auto-detect mode, ADET On (default) or 
ADET Off.  
EDIT Shortcut: If the menu entry you want to change is the last one 
used, you don't need to tap MENU; just hold EDIT. Change the 
parameter as usual, then exit by holding EDIT once more.

Calibration Functions 
 
The CAL menu provides the following functions: 
 
FCTR  
Frequency counter  
CUR  
Programmable transmit current limit 
TPA  
PA temperature set (see KPA100 manual) 
S LO  
S-meter zero set 
S HI  
S-meter full-scale sensitivity set 
PLL 
 
VFO linearization 
FIL 
 
Filter settings (see next page) 
 
After selecting a CAL function, hold EDIT to activate it. 
 
Frequency Counter (CAL FCTR) 
 
CAL FCTR displays the frequency of the signal at P6 on the 
Control board during alignment (see page 63). 
 
Transmit Current Limit (CAL CUR) 
 
CAL CUR allows you to set a safe maximum transmit current. The 
recommended setting is 3.50 A. A lower setting may be appropriate 
if you're using 5 watts or less, or if your power supply has a lower 
current rating. 
 
S-meter Calibration (CAL S LO, CAL S HI) 
 
To set the S-meter zero level: 
1. Disconnect the antenna. 
2. Make sure the RF GAIN control is fully clockwise (max gain). 
3. Select CAL S LO in the menu. 
4. Turn the VFO knob until the left-most bargraph segment is just 
barely turned off . 
5. Exit CAL mode by tapping MENU . 
 
To set S-meter sensitivity: 
1. Disconnect the antenna. 
2. Turn the RF GAIN control fully counter-clockwise (minimum gain). 
3. Select CAL S HI in the menu. 
4. Turn the VFO knob until the right-most bargraph segment is just 
barely turned on. 
5. Exit CAL mode by tapping MENU . 
Note: The S-meter must be recalibrated anytime the AGC threshold is 
changed. The AGC threshold adjustment is described on page 47. 
To set calibrate the S-meter S-9 level: 
If you have an Elecraft XG1 or XG2 test oscillator or other calibrated 
signal source, you may use it to calibrate your S-meter to indicate S-9 
when the signal level at the antenna jack is 50 µV as follows: 
1. Disconnect the antenna from the K2 and attach your test oscillator 
or signal generator. 
2. Turn the RF GAIN fully clockwise (maximum gain).  
3. Set the test oscillator or signal generator for an output of 50 
microvolts (-73 dBm). 
4. Tune in the test oscillator or signal generator and adjust the tuning 
for maximum indicated signal. 
5. Select CAL S HI in the menu. 
6. Turn the K2 main tuning knob until the S-meter indicates S-9 on the 
bargraph.  
7. Tap MENU to exit CAL mode.

VFO Linearization (CAL PLL) 
 
The CAL PLL function automatically calibrates VFO fine-
tuning13. You can repeat CAL PLL at any time, although this 
should not normally be necessary. One reason you might re-run 
CAL PLL is after calibrating the frequency counter (see Advanced 
Operating Features, page 105). In general, you'll need to re-run CAL 
PLL and CAL FIL anytime you change the setting of C22 
(Control board), which is used to align the 4 MHz crystal oscillator. 
 
To Linearize the VFO: 
 
1. Remove the top cover. The bottom cover must be installed. 
2. Allow a 10-minute warm-up period at room temperature. 
3. Connect the internal frequency counter cable to TP1 (VCO). 
4. Exit the menu if you were using it. 
5. Switch to 40 meters and set the VFO anywhere in the 7000-7100 
kHz range. 
6. Use the menu to activate CAL PLL.  
7. When calibration is completed (4-8 minutes), you'll hear a short 
alert tone and see End on the LCD. You can then tap any 
switch to return to normal operation.  
 
Filter Settings (CAL FIL) 
 
This section explains how to use CAL FIL to select the bandwidth 
and BFO settings. An example appears on the next page. The 
Elecraft web site provides information on other filter setup methods, 
including a method that uses a personal computer sound card. For a 
discussion of how the crystal filter and BFO settings are related, see 
page 111. 
 
                                                     
13 What you're actually calibrating is the relationship between the PLL 
(phase-locked loop) divider and the crystal reference oscillator. (See Circuit 
Details.) 
Basic CAL FIL Setup 
1. Connect the frequency counter test cable to TP2 (BFO).  
2. Set AF GAIN high enough to hear some background noise. 
3. Switch to a band between 160 m and 17 m. (The sideband is 
inverted on 15 m and above, which may be confusing during filter 
setup.) 
7. Select CW mode using MODE. If a bar appears above the C, the K2 
is in CW Reverse mode; hold  CW RV to select CW Normal mode. 
4. Tap XFIL until FL1 is selected. 
5. Tap MENU and scroll to CAL. Hold EDIT to move the underline 
to OFF, then scroll until you see CAL FIL. Finally, hold EDIT 
again to activate the filter display. 
 
Filter Bandwidth Display 
 
The initial CAL FIL display shows the present filter bandwidth and 
the operating mode, e.g. FL1 1.50c. The number 1.50 indicates a 
bandwidth of roughly 1.50 kHz.14 This parameter has a range of 0.00 - 
2.49. Above 2.49, the parameter changes to OP1 - OP5, which can 
be used to select optional filters. For example, the filter on the SSB 
adapter (KSB2) is OP1. 
 
Note the present bandwidth setting, then try using the VFO knob to 
change it. You'll hear the "shape" (or pitch) of the noise change. (Return 
to the original bandwidth after experimenting.)  
                                                     
14 The number shown should be used only as a relative indication of filter 
bandwidth. Actual bandwidth will probably be narrower.

    ELECRAFT® 
BFO Displays 
 
Tap BAND- to display the BFO setting for filter FL1, which will be 
similar to BF1t110c. The 3-digit number is the BFO control 
parameter. This number can be changed using the VFO knob, but 
you'll use a different BFO-setting method described below. The letter 
t after BF1 is a reminder that the BF1 BFO frequency is always 
used on transmit, which is important for SSB operation.  
 
Whenever the BFO control parameter is displayed, you can tap 
DISPLAY to show the actual BFO frequency in kHz. The VFO knob 
can then be used to set the BFO directly. This method is used in the 
filter-setup example.  
 
Note: After changing the BFO setting, you can tap AGC to re-
measure and save the BFO information without switching filters. 
This is useful if you want to try various BFO settings for a particular 
filter to find the one with the best audio peak. 
 
Other CAL FIL Operations 
 
When you're in CAL FIL you can always tap XFIL to change to the 
next filter, tap MODE to change modes, and hold CW RV to switch 
from CW normal to CW reverse. Whenever you switch modes or filters, 
the K2 will first record your new settings, if they have been changed.  
 
BAND+ switches to the filter bandwidth display, and BAND- switches 
to the BFO display. Tapping MENU exits CAL FIL and returns to the 
normal display. (On exit from CAL FIL, changes are saved.) 
 
Turning Selected Filters Off 
 
FL2, 3, or 4 can be individually disabled. To turn off a filter, display the 
filter bandwidth using CAL FIL, then set the bandwidth number to 
OFF. (To get to OFF, go to 0.00 first, then turn the VFO knob a bit 
farther counter-clockwise.)

CAL FIL Example (setting up all filters): 
  
Table 8-1 shows the recommended filer settings for a CW-only K2. 
If you already have the SSB adapter installed, use the SSB settings 
from the KSB2 manual. 
 
1. Read the CAL FIL instructions on the previous page if you 
haven't already. You'll need to be familiar with CAL FIL 
displays and controls before proceeding. 
2. Do the Basic CAL FIL Setup from the previous page exactly as 
described. You should then see a display similar to FL1 
1.50c. 
3. Using the VFO knob, set FL1 to the value shown for CW 
Normal (1.50). Tap XFIL to save the new value and move to 
FL2. (The CW Reverse bandwidth will also be updated.) 
4. Set up FL2, FL3, and FL4 in the same manner. 
5. Use XFIL to return to FL1. Tap BAND- to show BF1. 
6. Tap DISPLAY to show the actual BFO frequency. Use the VFO 
knob to select the value shown in the table. Typically you'll be able 
to get to within +/- 20 Hz of the target frequency. 
7. Tap XFIL to save the new value and move to BF2. Repeat steps 6 
and 7  to set up BF2, BF3, and BF4. 
8. Switch to CW Reverse by holding CW RV. Then repeat steps 6 and 
7 for each CW Reverse BFO setting (BF1-BF4). 
9. Tap BAND+ to return to the filter bandwidth display. Use the 
MODE switch to select LSB, and return to FL1 using XFIL. 
10. Set up each LSB filter bandwidth according to the table. (This also 
updates the USB filter bandwidths.) 
11. Tap BAND- and set up each LSB BFO as you did for CW. 
12. Tap MODE to select USB, and set up each USB BFO. 
13. If you use settings that differ from the defaults, record them in Table 
8-2. Use pencil, since you may change them later.

Basic K2 Operation 
 
Mode Selection 
Tap MODE to cycle through the operating modes, noting the change in 
the mode indicator letter (C = CW, L = lower sideband, U = upper 
sideband). If RTTY/data mode is enabled, r = RTTY/data will also 
appear in the mode list (see page 108). 
 
Sideband Inversion: The K2 inverts the sideband on 15 meters and 
above due to the frequency mixing scheme (the upper and lower 
sidebands of the signal become reversed). In CW Normal mode, the 
pitch of CW signals goes up with frequency on the lower bands; on 15 
m and up, the pitch goes down with frequency.  
 
Receiver Configuration 
Gain Controls: The RF GAIN control should normally be set fully 
clockwise. Adjust the AF GAIN control for comfortable volume. 
Sidetone volume is set using ST L(page 100). 
 
Crystal Filter Selection: Each operating mode provides up to four 
filter settings, FL1-FL4. Bandwidth and BFO settings can be 
customized using CAL FIL (page 91)15. Tapping XFIL  cycles 
through the filters. FL2, 3, or 4 can also be turned OFF. 
 
Filters and Operating Modes: The CW Normal and CW Reverse 
crystal filter selections are tied together. For example, if you switch to 
FL2 when in CW Normal mode, CW Reverse also switches to FL2. 
The same applies to the LSB and USB modes. 
 
Checking Filter Status: You can check the current filter number and 
its bandwidth without changing filters by holding 
XFIL + AGC. For example, you might see FL2 0.80c. If a KAF2 or 
KDSP2 audio filter is installed and enabled, you'll see audio filter info 
after the crystal filter display (e.g. AF1, CF1, SF1). 
                                                     
15 Bandwidth settings below 0.20 may cause excessive signal attenuation. 
Audio Filter Control: If you have a KAF2 or KDSP2 option (audio 
filter and real-time clock) installed, AFIL will control audio filter 
selection. Tap DISPLAY to activate other features. 
 
Preamp: The preamp provides about 14 dB gain. If you experience 
strong in-band interference, you may want to turn the preamp off. 
 
Attenuator: If necessary, 10 dB of attenuation can be switched in by 
turning on the attenuator. This is more effective than using the RF 
GAIN control in the case of strong-signal overload. 
 
Scanning: See Advanced Operating Features, page 103. 
 
Antenna Selection: If you're using a KAT2 or KAT100 automatic 
antenna tuner, the ANT 1/2 switch will toggle between the two ATU 
antenna jacks. This also instantly recalls the ATU's stored L-C 
parameters for each antenna. Refer to the relevant ATU manual. 
 
Noise Blanker Controls: The KNB2 option is required to use these 
controls. The noise blanker is always turned OFF on power-up, and 
you should leave it off unless needed. When it is turned on, the 
receiver will be more susceptible to interference from strong signals. 
To turn on the noise blanker, tap the NB switch. You’ll see  NB1,  
NB2, and OFF in that order. The NB1 and NB2 modes provide 
short or wide pulse blanking intervals, respectively. One may be more 
effective than the other, depending on the type of noise. In either 
mode, the NB annunciator will turn on. 
 
The noise blanker provides two thresholds of noise detection: high and 
low. If you hold LEVEL the noise blanker will toggle between these 
two modes, with the display showing HI THR or LO THR. High 
threshold is the default and should be used in most cases. If you select 
low threshold, the noise blanker may be more effective on certain 
types of noise, but it will also leave the receiver more vulnerable to 
strong in-band signals. When LO THR is selected, the NB 
annunciator flashes as a reminder.

LCD and Bargraph Configuration 
 
Day/Night Selection: For daytime outdoor operation, use the menu to 
select LCD DAY (LCD backlight off, and high-brightness LED 
bargraph). Indoors or at night, use LCD NITE (backlight on, reduced 
bargraph brightness). 
Bargraph Modes: You have a choice of OFF, DOT, or BAR for 
the LED bargraph. If you select DOT, just one bargraph segment 
representing the current meter level will be illuminated. If you select 
BAR, all LED segments to the left of the current level will also be 
illuminated, resulting in a more visible display. OFF mode turns off 
the bargraph completely during receive but uses DOT mode on 
transmit (see Advanced Operating Features).  
Display Modes: Tapping DISPLAY alternates between frequency 
display mode and voltage/current display mode. If you have the 
KAF2 or KDSP2 option installed (audio filter and real-time-clock), a 
time/date display will also be accessible (plus DSP settings in the case 
of the KDSP2). 
In frequency display mode, the LCD will show the operating 
frequency, mode indicator, and any annunciators that are enabled, e.g. 
24945.04c. This is the display you’ll use most often. 
In voltage/current display mode, the LCD will show supply voltage 
(E) in 0.1 V increments and supply current (I) in 0.02 A increments, 
e.g. E13.8i1.40. This is useful for monitoring battery condition. It 
can also be used with a simple voltage probe to check DC voltages 
inside the K2. Jumper P7, on the Control board, selects either 12 V 
monitoring or the voltage probe (P5). If the display shows 0.0 volts, 
P7 may be in the probe position. 
In time/date/DSP display mode, the LCD will show either time (e.g. 
08.05.00) or date (e.g. 11-28-02) or DSP settings. You can toggle 
between time and date by holding  BAND+ and BAND-  together. 
Refer to the KAF2 or KDSP2 manual for details on setting the time 
and date as well as other features. 
Frequency and Band Selection 
 
The basic K2 covers 80-10 meters, and you can also tune well above 
and below the ham bands.16  160 meters can be added with the 
K160RX option, and 60 meters with the K60XV. 60-meter users will 
probably want to set up channel hopping (see page 103).  
Transverter Bands: The K2 provides up to six programmable 
transverter band displays for use with external transverters. Refer to 
the TRNx menu entry (page 109). 
Transmit Limits: Some countries require transmit to be disabled 
outside of specified amateur bands. If you key the transmitter with the 
VFO set outside fixed limits, you’ll see End on the LCD. 
You can change bands in one of three ways: 
 
tap BAND+ or BAND-  
 
hold RCL (memory recall); see below 
 
use Direct Frequency Entry (described later) 
Whenever you change bands or recall a frequency memory, a number 
of parameters are saved in nonvolatile memory (EEPROM). This 
update also occurs periodically if you’ve moved the VFO (see Backup 
Timer). The parameters that are saved on a per-band basis include: 
 
A and B VFO frequencies and VFO tuning rate 
 
Current VFO (A or B) 
 
Operating mode (CW, USB, LSB) and CW Normal/reverse 
 
AGC slow/fast 
 
Preamp and attenuator on/off 
 
Noise blanker on/off (requires noise blanker option) 
 
ANT1/2 selection (ATU option) 
 
Receive antenna on/off (160 m/RX ant. option) 
                                                     
16 The receiver is not intended to be general coverage; narrow band-pass 
filters are used at the front end to reject out-of-band signals. If you attempt to 
tune too far outside an available band,  receiver sensitivity and transmit power 
will greatly decrease, and at some point the synthesizer will lose lock.

    ELECRAFT® 
Default Frequency Memories: When you first turn on the K2, each 
band memory is preset as follows: 
 
 
VFO A is set to the first multiple of 100 kHz  above the band edge 
(e.g. 7100, 24900). 
 
VFO B is set to the U.S. CW QRP frequency for that band 
 
Other defaults include: CW mode; VFO A; fast AGC; preamp ON 
above 40 meters and OFF on 40 m and below; noise blanker OFF 
and high threshold; antenna 2 OFF (antenna 1 selected); receive 
antenna OFF (normal receive operation) 
 
Memories #1-8 are preset to the same values as the 160-10 meter band 
memories, respectively. 
 
Store and Recall: Ten memories are provided, numbered 0 through 9. 
Each memory stores the same information that is stored per-band. 
 
To store the current setup in a frequency memory, hold STORE until 
you see ENT 0-9, then tap one of the numeric keypad switches. To 
recall a stored setup, hold RCL until you see  ENT 0-9, then tap the 
number of the memory you wish to recall. In both cases you can 
cancel the operation by tapping any non-numeric switch. 
 
Note: If you hold rather than tap a numeric keypad digit when doing 
either a store or recall, you will initiate scanning. See page 103. 
 
Direct Frequency Entry: To do direct frequency entry, hold both 
BAND+ and BAND- simultaneously. When you see  "-----" on the 
LCD, release the two switches, then enter the target frequency using 
the numeric keypad. To enter a frequency in the 160 meter band, you 
must enter 5 digits, starting with a leading 0, e.g. 0 1 8 3 5.  For other 
bands below 10 MHz, you need only enter 4 digits (e.g., 7 0 4 0). On 
transverter bands, direct frequency entry can only be used to go to a 
new frequency within the present band.  (see TRNx menu entry, page 
109). 
 
There are three possible results from using direct frequency entry: 
 
 
If you enter a frequency within the current band, only the current 
VFO will be updated. 
 
If you enter a frequency that is in a different band, a band change 
results, and the entire configuration for the target band will be 
loaded, except that the current VFO will now be at the frequency 
you just entered. 
 
If you enter a frequency that is too far outside any available band, 
you’ll be switched to the closest available band, and the frequency 
will be set to the one last used on that band. For example, if you 
try to switch to 8400 kHz--which is typically outside the range of 
the synthesizer--the K2 will switch to 40 meters and setup the 
VFOs as they last were on this band. 
 
Tuning Rates: The VFO tuning rate is selected by tapping RATE. 
Default tuning rates include 10 Hz, 50 Hz, and 1 kHz per step,  
resulting in 1 kHz, 5 kHz, and 100 kHz per VFO knob turn. Other 
tuning rates can be selected; see the RATES menu entry (page 107).    
 
The frequency display changes to remind you of the current tuning 
rate. At 10 Hz/step, two decimal places are shown (100 Hz and 10 
Hz). When you select 50 Hz/step, the 10 Hz digit is blank. When you 
select 1 kHz/step, both decimal places are blank. 
 
VFO Lock: The current VFO frequency can be locked by holding the 
LOCK switch until LOC is displayed. The decimal point will then 
flash slowly as a reminder. Split Operation: Lock applies only to the 
current (receive) VFO. So, while you are holding the REV switch 
(temporary VFO reverse), you can change the frequency of the other 
VFO (transmit), overriding lock. This is very useful when operating 
SPLIT, since it allows you to check and modify your transmit 
frequency without unlocking the receive VFO. 
 
Holding the switch again cancels lock and displays NOR (normal).

Power Control 
 
Turn the POWER control to set the power output directly in watts 
(e.g., P 5.0). The normal range of  the control is 0.1 to 15 watts. If 
you have the KPA100 option installed and enabled, the range is 0.1 to 
110 watts, with the amplifier module disabled at 10 watts or lower. In 
CW mode, you must send a few CW characters or press TUNE to 
allow the ALC (automatic level control) to lock-in the new power 
level. 
 
Requested vs. Actual Power: The POWER control sets the requested 
power, which may exceed the actual power that the transmitter can 
achieve. To see actual power output, use TUNE (see below). In tune 
mode, the display always shows the actual power output (except when 
the display is showing voltage and current, or when the ATU is doing 
an autotune). The power displayed will be accurate to within about 
10% if the load at the antenna is matched (50 ohms). 
 
Using TUNE: Hold TUNE to key the transmitter. You’ll hear one beep 
when you start tune, and another when you terminate tune by tapping 
any switch or hitting the keyer paddle. 
 
ATU: If you're using a KAT2 or KAT100 automatic antenna tuner, 
pressing TUNE will drop power to either 2 or 20 watts maximum 
(depending on whether the KPA100 is in use), and may trigger a re-
tune of the antenna matching network. You can also override power 
reduction by holding TUNE + DISPLAY (see page 98). 
 
Transverter Bands: Maximum power output on each transverter band 
can be set in watts or milliwatts (the latter requires the K60XV 
option). See page 109. 
 
Current Limiting: To protect the transmitter and power 
supply/battery from excess current drain, you can program a transmit 
current limit using CAL CUR (see Calibration Functions). 
 
 
VFO Selection 
 
To select the A or B VFO, tap A/B. To set the unused VFO equal in 
frequency to the current VFO, tap A=B. The currently-selected VFO 
will determine both the transmit and receive frequencies unless you’re 
running SPLIT (see below). A and B VFO frequencies are saved in 
EEPROM on a per-band basis, and are updated periodically (see 
Backup Timer at the end of this section). 
 
Split and Reverse Operation 
 
Split operation means transmitting and receiving on different 
frequencies. This is useful for DX work, since many DX stations will 
ask you to call them above or below their carrier frequency to avoid 
interference. To enter split mode, hold SPLIT until the message 
SPLIT appears on the LCD. Holding SPLIT in again will display 
NOR (normal). The active VFO annunciator (A or B) will flash 
slowly when you’re in SPLIT mode to remind you that this feature is 
enabled and that your receive and transmit frequencies are different. 
Also, each time you transmit when in SPLIT mode, the transmit 
frequency is displayed for a minimum of 1/2 second. 
 
 
When you're using split, you can switch between your transmit and 
receive frequencies by tapping A/B. However, there are times when 
you only want to quickly listen on your transmit frequency, not switch 
VFOs. In this case you can hold in the REV switch (reverse), which 
temporarily swaps the VFOs. When you release REV, the LCD will 
return immediately to the receive frequency. When using split, 
experienced operators can simultaneously hold in the REV switch and 
adjust the VFO knob--all with one hand--to quickly find a clear spot to 
transmit. (REV overrides VFO lock as described previously.) 
 
You can install an LED on the front panel that will turn on whenever 
SPLIT, RIT, or XIT is in effect. See the associated application note, 
Adding a SPLIT/RIT/XIT LED to the K2.

RIT and XIT 
 
You can turn on RIT (receive incremental tuning) by tapping RIT. The 
RIT annunciator then turns on. It flashes slowly if you have selected a 
wide-range RIT/XIT offset (see RIT menu entry, page 108). The 
OFFSET knob controls the receive offset. 
 
The +1 and -1 kHz marks on the offset control apply only if the 
RIT/XIT range is set to +/- 1.2 kHz using the RIT menu entry. 
Regardless of the range used, the exact offset can be determined by 
comparing the VFO frequencies with RIT on and off.17 
 
When XIT is turned on, it works similarly to RIT, except that the 
transmit frequency is varied with the OFFSET control. This can be 
useful for small-split operation (for example, when a DX station you're 
listening to says to call "UP 1" kHz), or to adjust your transmitted 
frequency at the request of another station. The transmitted frequency 
is not displayed during receive mode, so if you need to determine the 
exact setting of the offset control when using XIT, you can briefly turn 
on RIT. 
 
It's OK to have both XIT and RIT on at the same time. In this case the 
OFFSET control can be thought of as an extension to the main tuning 
knob, but covering only a small frequency range.  
 
As with SPLIT, if you have RIT or XIT enabled, the transmit 
frequency will be displayed when you transmit, and the receive 
frequency will be restored a minimum of 1/2 second later. 
 
FINE RIT:  In some cases you may want to control the VFO in 
smaller steps to fine-tune signals on receive. This can be done using 
the FINE RIT feature, described on page 106. 
                                                     
17 We did not include detent on the offset knob because experience has shown 
that knob detent mechanisms degrade over time, making it difficult to adjust 
the offset near the zero point. However, you can always return the offset knob 
to the zero point by simply matching the RIT-on and RIT-off frequency 
displays, or by turning RIT off. 
Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU) 
 
Both the low-power internal automatic antenna tuner (model KAT2) 
and high-power external antenna tuner (KAT100) can match nearly 
any coax-fed or random-length antenna on multiple bands. ATU 
functions will be covered briefly here; refer to the specific ATU 
manual for details. 
 
The operating mode of the KAT2 or KAT100 is selected using the 
ATU menu entry, and is normally set to AUTO. The menu entry also 
allows you to see the L and C selection, step through ATU relays, etc. 
Note: If you have both a KAT2 and a KAT100 connected to your K2, 
the ATU menu entry will control only the KAT100. The KAT2 will 
be placed in through mode (L and C = 0), and will be set to antenna 1.  
 
The ATU is activated whenever you press TUNE. The K2 display will 
show SWR or forward/reflected power, depending on the tuner's 
mode. If a KPA100 is installed, its TUNE display will be used. Power 
is reduced to 2 watts during TUNE mode (20 watts if the KPA100 is 
enabled). This power reduction can be overridden by holding TUNE + 
DISPLAY. In this case, no auto-tune will be attempted. 
 
Two antenna jacks are provided on both ATUs, with the matching 
network data for both antennas stored on a per-band basis. You can tap 
ANT 1/2  to switch antennas. Since the relays take only a small 
fraction of a second to switch, it becomes practical to quickly try both 
antennas anytime the distant station is weak. This is particularly useful 
for Field-Day and similar contests, where you might use two end-fed 
random wires running in different directions. 
 
Backup Timer 
 
While you're moving the VFO, a 30-second data backup timer is being 
continuously re-started. Once you have completely stopped tuning the 
VFO for at least 30 seconds, the K2 will then save your current 
operating frequency in EEPROM. As long as you stay on a particular 
frequency, no further updates will be done.

CW Operation 
 
The K2 provides a number of features for the CW operator: 
 
fast I.F.-derived AGC with fast/slow/off control 
 
full break-in operation with no relays 
 
accurate control of sidetone volume and sidetone pitch/offset 
 
memory keyer with Iambic modes A and B,  
 
nine programmable message buffers; chaining and auto-repeat 
 
software-selectable paddle selection (normal or reverse) 
 
multiple crystal filter bandwidths and opposite-sideband CW 
 
dedicated SPOT switch for accurate signal pitch matching. 
 
optional analog or digital audio filter 
Several advanced CW features are covered in later sections: 
 
Fast-Play ("one touch") message buffers (page 107) 
 
Adjustable keying weight (page 107) 
 
"smart" CW signal scanning (page 103) 
 
FINE RIT for fine-tuning CW signals (page 106) 
 
Keying Device Selection 
A single connector in the back is provided for your keyer paddle, hand 
key, keyer, or computer. It is also possible to connect both a paddle 
and an external keyer or computer at the same time (see External 
Keying Auto-Detect, below). 
You must use a stereo (2-circuit) plug, even if you use only a hand key 
or external keyer. This should not affect the use of the keying device 
with other equipment, since the middle contact on the plug (often 
called the "ring" contact) is only used with keyer paddles. 
Hand key or External Keying Device: To use a hand key or external 
keying device, select INP HAND using the menu. Use the "tip" 
contact (DOT) of the key jack with a hand key or external keying 
device. You can key the K2 externally at up to 70 WPM.  
 
Internal Keyer: To use a keyer paddle, use the menu to choose INP 
PDLn or INP PDLr (normal or reverse paddle). With PDLn 
selected, the "tip" contact on the stereo key jack is DOT and "ring" 
(the middle contact) is DASH. PDLr is the reverse. 
External Keying Auto-Detect:  If you wish to connect a handkey, 
external keyer or computer along with a keyer paddle, you can use the 
K2’s "auto-detect" feature. Simply connect your external keying 
device to the DOT and DASH lines through two diodes as shown in 
Figure 8-1, along with the keyer paddle. Be sure you have selected  
INP PDLn or INP PDLR in the menu.  
 
Figure 8-1 
When you connect the keying devices in this way, you can continue to 
use the paddle as usual. But if the external keying device is keyed, 
both the DOT and DASH lines will be pulled low simultaneously via 
the diodes. The K2 firmware interprets this as direct external keying 
rather than as DOT or DASH triggers.  
 
Auto Detect can be turned off if desired. Find the INP menu entry, 
EDIT the parameter, then tap DISPLAY to select ADET OFF.

Basic CW Setup 
Mode Selection: To place the rig in CW mode, tap the MODE switch 
until the mode indicator changes to C.  
Filter Selection: Select a crystal filter using the XFIL switch. FL1 is 
usually configured as the widest filter. Similarly, use AFIL to select an 
audio filter (requires KAF2 or KDSP2). Note: If you have the KSB2 
installed, you can use CAL FIL to configure FL1 as OP1 (SSB 
option filter) in CW and CW reverse modes, and leave FL2-4 at the 
narrower factory defaults (0.7, 0.4, and 0.2). Details on how to do this 
setup can be found in the SSB adapter manual.  
CW Frequency Display: In CW mode, the frequency shown on the 
LCD takes into account an offset equal to your sidetone pitch. This 
allows you to determine a station's actual carrier frequency by 
matching their pitch to your sidetone, rather than by zero-beating the 
signal. The SPOT switch can be used for this purpose. 
Operate vs. Test mode:  If you want to try out the keying without 
actually transmitting, hold the VOX switch until the display shows 
TEST. The mode letter C on the LCD will flash to remind you that 
you have disabled transmit. Holding the VOX switch in again returns 
to OPERate. 
Sidetone Setup:  Key the rig in TEST mode and listen to the 
sidetone volume and pitch. To change the volume, use the menu’s ST 
L entry (sidetone level). The pitch can be changed using the ST P 
entry  (sidetone pitch). ST L is used often, so you might want to 
assign it to PF1 or PF2 (see Advanced Operating Features).  
Break-in (QSK) delay: The QSK delay is set using the T-R menu 
option. A setting of 0.00 is fastest, although you may prefer the 
break-in sound with 0.01 selected, especially when using 
headphones. 0.05 is about right for casual operation. You can select a 
longer delay (up to 2.5 seconds) for slower CW work or to prevent un-
muting when sending a repeating beacon message. 
 
The SPOT Switch 
The SPOT switch can be used to zero-in on received signals or to test 
your sidetone pitch quickly, without having to key the transmitter or 
enter the menu. It’s important to use SPOT before using CW reverse. 
Once a signal has been SPOTted, you’ll only hear a slight change in 
pitch when you use the CW RV switch. 
When you use SPOT, receiver audio will not be muted. This allows 
you to listen to another station and turn the VFO knob until the pitch 
of the received signal matches that of the sidetone. Once the two 
match, you’ll be very close to the station’s frequency if you call. 
(Exception: If you’re using RIT, XIT, or SPLIT, your transmit and 
receive frequencies will differ by more than just the normal 
transmit/receive offset. Turn off these features when using SPOT.) 
Matching audio pitch may be difficult for some operators. Basically, 
you’ll need to tune the VFO up and down until the station you’re 
hearing seems to "disappear" under the sidetone--that is, until you 
can’t hear any difference between the two. When this happens, you’ll 
know the two pitches are matched. 
Using the Internal Keyer 
Two menu entries are provided to set up the keyer: 
 
IAB allows you to select Iambic mode A or B. (Mode A is 
similar to Curtis mode A; mode B is similar to Super CMOS 
Keyer III mode B. If you aren't sure which to use, start with mode 
A, which has less critical timing requirements.) 
 
INP selects paddle normal (PDLn), paddle reverse (PDLr), or 
hand key/ext. keyer (HAND) 
These settings are stored in EEPROM, so you won’t lose them when 
you turn power off. 
Use the KEYER control to select the desired CW speed. The display 
shows the speed in WPM as soon as you start turning the knob. You 
can adjust the keyer speed even while transmitting.

Message Memories 
 
The K2 provides nine CW message memories of 250 bytes each. 
Playback features include message repeat and 1-level chaining. CW 
messages can only be recorded using a keyer paddle connected 
directly to the K2's key jack. Set INP to PDLn or PDLr. 
 
To record a message: Hold REC, and when prompted tap a numbered 
switch  (#0-8) to select one of the nine message buffers. The display 
will then show REC 250, indicating that 250 bytes of storage are 
available in this message buffer. This number will count down toward 
0 as long as you are sending. Whenever you stop sending, up to two 
standard-length word spaces will be inserted. To stop recording, tap 
MSG. If you do this before starting to send, the original message 
contents will not be lost. 
 
To play back a message: Tap MSG, then select a message buffer (#0-
8). Message play can be canceled at any time by hitting MSG again or 
by tapping the keyer paddle. To listen to a message without 
transmitting, use TEST mode (VOX switch). 
 
Auto-Repeat: Any message memory can be auto-repeated when 
played. To auto-repeat, tap MSG as usual, then hold the desired 
numbered switch (#0-8). The message will then play back 
continuously until you tap MSG again or hit your key or paddle. The 
buffer # will flash at the end of each transmission (e.g., B6).  
 
Note: You cannot change the frequency with the VFO knob during a 
repeating message, but you can use RIT (if enabled) to listen above 
and below your receive frequency between calls.  
 
Setting the Auto-Repeat Interval: The length of the pause between 
messages during auto-repeat can be programmed using the RPT menu 
entry (0-255 sec.). Long delays are useful for beacons.  
Message Chaining and chain/repeat: While a message is playing, 
you can tap #0-8 to chain a message onto the end of the current one. 
The buffer number will be displayed twice: once when you hit the 
numbered switch, and again when the chained message starts. To 
chain a repeating message onto the current message, HOLD rather 
than TAP the numbered switch (i.e., use #0-8). Chaining is useful 
during contests. For example, you might set up message 5 as "QSL  
73"  and message 6 as "CQ TEST DE N6KR." You could then hit 
MSG 5 6 at the end of a QSO to sign with the previous contact, then 
begin a repeating CQ. 
 
CW Reverse 
 
CW Reverse allows you to listen to CW using the opposite sideband. 
Sometimes this can eliminate or reduce interference from a strong 
station without reducing the strength of the desired signal. To switch 
to the opposite sideband, hold the CW RV (CW reverse) switch. A bar 
will appear above the mode letter C on the LCD. (Use SPOT first to 
stay on frequency when you switch to CW reverse.) 
 
Sidetone Pitch and Receive Offset 
 
When you change the sidetone pitch using the ST P menu entry, 
you’re also changing the CW receive offset. The two always match 
within approximately 10 Hz. This ensures that when you listen to other 
stations at same pitch as the sidetone, your transmitted signal will be 
right on that station’s frequency.  
 
To see how the receive offset tracks the sidetone pitch: Use SPOT to 
tune in a station at your current sidetone pitch as described earlier. 
Then use ST P to change the pitch. As soon as you exit the menu, 
you’ll notice that the station you were listening to has also been shifted 
to the new sidetone pitch. 
 
Changing the sidetone pitch does not automatically re-adjust the BFO 
frequencies in relation to the crystal filter passband. So if you change 
your sidetone pitch, you should use CAL FIL to manually optimize 
the BFO settings.

SSB Operation 
 
You can receive SSB and data-mode signals with a basic K2, but 
transmitting in these modes requires a KSB2 SSB adapter. For 
complete details on SSB transmit, refer to the KSB2 manual. 
 
SSB Controls 
 
Operating Mode: Use MODE to select L (LSB) or U (USB). To 
alternate directly between USB and LSB, use CW RV. LSB is usually 
used on 40 meters and below, and USB is used on the higher bands.  
 
Crystal Filter Selection: If the SSB adapter is installed, you'll be able 
to take advantage of its 7-pole fixed-bandwidth filter, designated OP1 
in CAL FIL. This filter can be used in all modes. 
 
DSP Filtering, Notch, and Noise Reduction: Refer to the KDSP2 
option manual for details on these features. 
 
SSB Menu Entries:  SSBA is used to set the mic audio level (mic 
gain), from 1 to 3. An additional setting, BAL, is used during SSB 
adapter alignment. SSBC is used to set the speech compression level, 
from 1-1 to 4-1. Higher settings add "punch" and are especially 
useful at low power levels. 
 
PTT/VOX Selection: By default the K2 uses PTT (push-to-talk) via 
your mic's PTT switch. To use VOX (voice-operated transmit), hold 
the VOX switch until you see SPCH 0.2, 0.4, or 1.0 on the LCD. 
The number 0.2 - 1.0 is the VOX delay time in seconds. Holding VOX 
again restores the setting to PTT. 
Power/ALC Metering: If you have the SSB adapter installed, you’ll 
be able to switch between RF and ALC bargraph meter modes by 
holding RF/ALC. ALC metering is used only in SSB modes, and may 
help in setting the mic gain and speech compression level. The ALC 
reading starts from the right end of the bargraph rather than the left, 
using BAR mode, so you won’t confuse it with the RF display. Use RF 
meter  mode except when checking ALC level.  
Microphone Configuration 
 
You’ll need to configure the MIC CONFIG header on the Front Panel 
board in order to transmit SSB on the K2. Most microphones with 
standard 8-pin connectors can be used. All Elecraft microphones 
include 8 small jumper blocks to simply installation. 
 
On many mics, the Up and Down buttons can be configured to switch 
between VFO A and B. You'll hear one beep on switching to VFO A, 
and two beeps when switching to VFO B. 
 
RTTY/Data Operation 
 
RTTY/data operation can be accomplished in SSB modes by using 
AFSK (audio frequency shift keying) or other modulation modes. 
Audio must be fed into the mic jack from a computer or modem, and 
the K2’s audio output routed to the computer or modem from either 
the headphone or speaker jack. Either LSB or USB can be used; this 
will probably be determined by your software. You can use either the 
SSB adapter's fixed filter (OP1) or the variable-bandwidth crystal 
filter for receive purposes. On transmit, OP1 is always used.  
 
Since some RTTY/data mode duty cycles approach 100%, you should 
reduce power to about 5W or avoid transmitting at 10W for longer 
than 1-2 minutes at a time. (Power levels above 10 W are not 
recommended.) You can key the transmitter via either the key jack or 
the mic jack, since the DOT line is also the PTT line. 
 
RTTY/Data Mode (mode letter r): This is a special fourth mode of 
operation that provides independent crystal filter selections for use 
with RTTY, PSK31, etc. For details on configuring and using 
RTTY/data mode, see page 108. 
 
FINE RIT:  Fine RIT allows you to vary the receive frequency in 
increments smaller than 10 Hz. This is especially useful with PSK31 
and other narrow-band data modes. See page 106.

Advanced Operating Features 
 
A number of specialized operating techniques are described in this 
section: 
 
 
Scanning and channel hopping (see below) 
 
Reducing current drain for portable operation 
 
Using a separate receive antenna 
 
Programming the PF1/PF2 functions 
 
AGC on/off control 


 
Resetting to factory defaults 


Also see Secondary Menu Functions (page 107). 
 
Scanning and Channel Hopping 
 
The K2's scanning features let the K2 tune any band segment 
continuously, or channel-hop among two or more memories, with or 
without the receiver squelched. Scanning when squelched allows the 
K2 to ignore stable carriers (key-down signals with no modulation), 
stopping only when "interesting" signals are found. Scanning with the 
receiver "live" (unsquelched) is especially useful when listening for 
weak signals on very quiet bands.  
 
60-Meter Channels: Channel-hopping (manually or using scan) is 
intended primarily for use on 60 meters. The present U.S. 60-meter 
channel designations are 5330.5, 5346.5, 5366.5, 5371.5, and 5403.5 
kHz (USB only). Typically these would be programmed into 
memories 1-5. See channel hopping details at right. 
 
Scan Resume: Scan-mode users may wish to use the menu to program 
PF2 (or PF1) as SCAN RESUME. Holding that switch will then re-
start scan without having to use the RCL / STORE method. 
To use continuous scanning (from VFO A to VFO B): 
 
 
Setup VFOs A and B for the two ends of the band of interest. VFO 
A must be set for a frequency lower than VFO B. 
 
Select the operating mode, preamp/attenuator setting, and tuning 
rate (RATE). Select a narrow filter if the band is noisy. 
 
Store this setting in any memory (using the STORE switch), but 
instead of tapping the switch for the desired memory, hold the 
numbered switch (0-9) until you see SCAN on the display. You 
can also initiate scanning when you recall a stored memory. Just 
hold RCL, then hold the numbered switch, as with STORE. The 
memories can store up to 10 scan ranges for instant recall. 
 
To scan with the receiver live (unsquelched), continue to hold the 
numbered button until you see AF ON. If the tuning rate is set 
for 10 Hz steps, live scanning proceeds at 50 kHz/minute. 
 
During squelched scanning, when a station is found, the receiver 
will un-squelch and will stay on that frequency for about 25 
seconds or until the signal fades.  
 
You can stop scanning by tapping any switch, key, or PTT. 
 
Use SCAN RESUME (PF1 or PF2, see at left) to restart scan. To 
resume "live" scanning, hold until you see AF ON. 
 
To use channel hopping (manually or with scanning): 
 
 
Set up and STORE two or more memories for the target band 
(using VFO A only).  Then choose one memory as the "initializer" 
to be used when starting channel scan, and RCL it. 
 
Edit the RATES secondary menu parameter (page 107);  tap 
DISPLAY to select CH SC (channel scan) or CH SC-TN 
(channel scan plus manual hopping);  exit the menu;  STORE this 
memory. If manual hopping is enabled, you can now use the VFO 
to hop among memories assigned to this band. 
 
Scanning can be initiated via RCL or STORE. The scan rate is 0.2 
seconds per channel (0.5 seconds per channel for "live" scanning). 
Note: VFO B can be set up differently on a per-channel basis for 
split operation, if desired, or you can fine-tune channels when 
necessary by turning on both RIT and XIT.

    ELECRAFT® 
Reducing Current Drain for Portable Operation 
 
You can use any of the methods listed below to reduce receive-mode 
current drain and thus extend battery life. These techniques will have 
only a small effect on transmit current drain, however. Reduce power 
output to the lowest effective level if you're transmitting frequently on 
a weak battery. 
 
 
Use headphones or reduce speaker volume. 
 
Turn off the RF preamp. 
 
Set GRPH to DOT mode. There's also an OFF mode, which 
completely disables the S-meter and forces DOT mode for 
transmit power display. 
 
Set OPT (Optimization) to BATT (battery); this reduces the I.F. 
post-mixer amplifier current by about 40 mA and automatically 
forces the bargraph to use DOT mode if set for BAR. Receive 
performance is minimally affected by this setting unless you have 
very strong in-band stations nearby. 
 
Set LCD to DAY to turn off the LCD backlight. This is most 
effective if you also set GRPH to OFF, since each bargraph 
LED segment that is turned on in DAY mode uses about 18 mA. 
(Each segment uses only 6 mA in NITE mode.) 
 
Note: Voltage/current display mode can be used to verify the effect of 
each setting.  
 
Using a Separate Receive Antenna 
 
The 160 m/RXANT option (K160RX) provides a separate receive 
antenna which can be enabled on a pre-band basis. 
 
To enable the receive antenna: Switch to the desired band. Use the 
menu to change the RANT option to ON. The preamp and attenuator 
settings with RANT ON can be set independently from of their 
normal settings. If you switch between the normal and receive 
antennas often, you can program PF1 or PF2 as RANT, and it will 
switch immediately (one switch press).  
Programmable Function Switches (PF1/PF2) 
 
The PF1 and PF2 switches (below RIT and XIT, respectively) can be 
programmed as direct edit shortcuts to any two menu entries of your 
choice, including secondary menu entries (see page 107). Two special 
functions can also be assigned to PF1 or PF2: Fast Play (FPon, 
page 107) and SCAN RESUME (SCAN, page 103).  
 
To program PF1 or PF2: Enter the menu and scroll to PF1 or PF2, 
then change the parameter to the desired entry. Exit the menu.  
 
To use PF1 or PF2: HOLD one of these switches to activate the 
selected menu shortcut, then change the menu parameter (which will 
be underlined) using the VFO knob or BAND+ / BAND-. To return to 
normal operation, tap any switch or the keyer paddle. Exceptions: the 
FPon, SCAN and RANT functions take effect immediately. 
 
Using PF1 or PF2 as secondary menu shortcuts: Enter the menu 
and scroll to PF1 or PF2. To switch to the secondary menu entries, 
tap DISPLAY. (Tapping DISPLAY again will return to the primary 
menu entries.) Select the desired parameter, then exit the menu. 
 
AGC On/Off Control 
 
Some operators prefer to turn AGC off and use manual RF GAIN 
control under certain weak-signal conditions.  
 
To turn off AGC: Hold both the PRE/ATT and AGC switches 
simultaneously. Release the switches when you see OFF flashed on 
the LCD. To remind you that AGC is off, the decimal point to the left 
of the mode indicator will flash slowly. Received signals will no 
longer affect the S-meter level. Turning the RF GAIN control counter-
clockwise will increase the S-meter reading.

Frequency Calibration Techniques 
 
The VFO is only as accurate as the 4.000 MHz oscillator on the 
Control board, which is calibrated using C22. C22 can be fine-tuned 
using one of the following methods: 
 
Using an External Counter or Ham-Band Receiver: 
 
These methods are described in detail in Alignment, Part II (4 MHz 
Oscillator Calibration). After setting C22 using either technique, you 
must re-run CAL PLL (with the counter probe on TP1). You'll also 
need to use CAL FIL (with the probe on TP2) to re-adjust each BFO 
setting, which will allow the K2 to store new, more accurate BFO 
frequency measurements. 
 
Using a Calibrated Signal Source: 
 
You can calibrate C22 using a signal generator, ham transmitter, or 
strong AM carrier such as WWV at 10 MHz. The K2’s receiver is 
used to zero-beat this signal to determine how far off the VFO is, then 
C22 is adjusted to compensate. Here's the procedure: 
 
1. Select LSB or USB mode on the K2. 
2. Zero-beat the calibrated signal source on the K2, then note the 
VFO dial error. For example, 10 MHz WWV might zero-beat at 
10000.20 kHz. The error is then 10000.20 - 10000.00 = +0.20. Do 
not move the VFO from this position. 
3. Connect the K2's internal counter to the VCO test point (TP1). 
4. Select and activate CAL FCTR using the menu. 
5. Note the displayed VCO frequency. (In this example, 14913.88 
kHz. Your VCO frequency will be somewhat different.) 
6. Subtract the VFO dial error from the VCO to obtain a target VCO 
frequency. (In our example, 14913.88 - 0.20 = 14913.68.) 
7. Adjust C22 until the VCO is at the target frequency.  
8. Re-run CAL PLL (see Calibration Functions). Tap MENU to 
exit CAL PLL when "End" appears. 
9. Move the counter probe to TP2 (BFO). Using CAL FIL, change 
the BFO control parameter for the filter presently being used by at 
least one count, then return it to the original setting. Tap MENU to 
exit without switching filters. This will force the K2 to re-measure 
the BFO frequency. 
10. Repeat step 2. If the VFO dial is still off, repeat steps 3 - 9. 
11. Modify all BFO settings using CAL FIL (as in step 9). 
 
Firmware Revision Numbers 
 
You can check the K2's main microcontroller and I/O controller 
firmware revisions by holding in any switch on power-up. Two 
numbers will then be displayed briefly. For example, you might see  
2.04P  1.09. The first number is the main microcontroller's 
firmware revision and letter suffix. The second number is the I/O 
controller's firmware revision.  
 
The KAT2 or KAT100 firmware revision is one of the parameters in 
the ATU submenu, e.g. F1.00. The KPA100 firmware revision can 
be found in the PA submenu. The KSB2 firmware revision can be 
obtained by first setting the SSBA menu entry to BAL, then holding 
the VOX switch. (Return the SSBA menu entry to its normal setting 
after checking the firmware revision.)  
 
The firmware revisions for other options may also be accessible; refer 
to the individual option manuals.

Resetting the Configuration to Factory Defaults 
You should reset configuration data to defaults only if the K2’s 
EEPROM is accidentally corrupted. (This is extremely unlikely to 
happen.) The most likely symptom that this has occurred would be an 
unexpected frequency setting showing up on a particular band, or 
strange characters appearing on the LCD. Before resetting the 
configuration to defaults, try simply re-entering the correct frequency 
and storing it in the affected memory. 
If you find it necessary to reset to defaults, record the following data 
first: 
 
filter and BFO settings for all modes/filters (using CAL FIL) 
 
other CAL parameters, e.g. S-meter HI/LO, current limiting 
 
primary menu parameters 
 
secondary menu parameters, if applicable 
To reset to defaults: Turn the K2 off, then hold down the 4, 5, and 6 
switches, and turn power back on. The EEPROM will be rewritten 
with factory defaults. You can then re-enter the data saved above using 
the menu functions. Re-doing CAL PLL is also recommended. 
Computer Control of the K2 
If you have the RS232 interface adapter installed (model KIO2), or the 
100-watt stage (KPA100), you’ll be able to use a computer to control 
the K2. Both the KIO2 and KPA100 provide true RS232 levels (at 
4800 baud), with no need for a level converter.  
The K2's computer-control capabilities are compatible with nearly all 
contesting, logging, and remote-control software, including Elecraft's 
k2remote and k2voice programs. Control over the internet is also 
possible. You can write your own programs as well (see the KIO2 
Programmer's Reference, on our web site).  
Refer to the KIO2 or KPA100 manuals for additional details.  
Fine RIT Mode 
The K2's FINE RIT feature provides receiver tuning in steps smaller 
than 10 Hz. The primary use of FINE RIT is for data modes such as 
PSK31, which can benefit from a reduction in T/R frequency shift 
between FL1 and one other filter18. FINE RIT mode is only effective 
for this if FL1 is configured as OP1 (SSB crystal filter). FINE RIT 
can also be used to accurately zero-beat AM stations, or to fine-tune 
CW signals when a narrow filter is used.  
Limitations: Entering FINE RIT mode turns off SPLIT, RIT, and 
XIT, which cannot be used in combination with FINE RIT. If you 
move the VFO while using FINE RIT, you may need to readjust the 
OFFSET control due to small differences in linearity over the VFO's 
tuning range. 
To use FINE RIT: Select a narrow data-mode filter (FL2 - FL4) 
using XFIL. Next, hold RIT and XFIL together; the display will show 
FINE ON, and the RIT and XIT annunciators will alternate on/off 
slowly. Only FL1 and the selected narrow filter will now be 
available; the other two will be temporarily disabled. You can then use 
the OFFSET knob to fine-adjust the signal pitch of the narrow filter 
without affecting the pitch of FL1. Turning the OFFSET knob will 
display the filter selection and the FINE RIT offset, from -15 to +15 
units (e.g.,  FL3  -12). One unit is about 1 to 3 Hz (finer on lower 
bands). When you transmit (always through OP1), you will be closer 
to the received station's carrier frequency, and on receive, switching 
filters will result in few if any lost characters.  
To cancel FINE RIT: Hold RIT + XFIL, or change modes or bands. 
FINE OFF will be displayed. 
                                                     
18 In data modes, the TX and RX frequency will always be exactly the same if 
you use only FL1 (if set to OP1), and avoid using splits. However, you may 
wish to switch to a narrow filter when QRM is present. The shift in frequency 
between OP1 (which is used on transmit) and the narrow filter can cause the 
signal to "walk" up or down the band if "net" is turned on in the demodulation 
software. Most software provides a means of turning off "net" (i.e. locking 
the TX frequency). FINE RIT provides a supplemental tool.

DISPLAY Switch Usage in EDIT Mode: The DISPLAY switch is 
used to access supplemental parameters when editing certain menu 
entries (marked "*" above). You will normally not need to change 
these settings. Entries which use DISPLAY include: 
Menu Entry 
DISPLAY Usage 
PORT  
Sends an RS232 test message if PORT is ON 
PA 
 
Selects PA fan mode (see KPA100 manual) 
TRN1-6 
Selects transverter parameters (see page 109) 
D19 
Selects PA low-pass filter to use on 60 meters. 
PA60=80 (80 m filter) or PA60=40 (40/30 m 
filter). See instructions in K60XV manual. 
 
Squelch (SLCH) 
Squelch defaults to OFF. You can set the threshold to 1-10, 
corresponding to the S-meter's bargraph segments. Transmitting holds 
squelch open for about 10 seconds. 
Tuning Rate Selection (RATES) 
The RATES menu entry lets you specify how the RATE switch 
works. The four options are: 
3N  
3 rates, normal order (10/50/1000 Hz steps) 
3R  
3 rates, reverse order (1000/50/10 Hz steps) 
3C 
3 rates, CW optimized (10/20/1000 Hz steps) 
2 
2 rates (10/50 Hz steps only) 
Keying Weight (DOT) 
DOT sets the internal keyer's dot/space ratio (keying weight). The 
range is 0.90-1.40, roughly 90% to 140% of "normal" weighting. 
The default is 1.10.  
Fast-Play CW Messages (FPLY)       
CW messages are normally played by tapping MSG, then 0-8. During 
contests, some operators prefer to have one-touch access, which we 
refer to as Fast-Play.  
To use Fast-Play: First, program PF1 or PF2 as  FPon for use in 
turning Fast-Play mode on/off. Next, use the FPLY menu entry to 
select a switch group. For example, if you have FPLY 2-5 selected, 
you can use 2, 3, 4, and 5 for Fast-Play. (The TAP functions of these 
switches won't be available in CW mode; HOLD functions are 
unaffected.) When Fast-Play is on, the letter F will replace the mode 
letter c once every few seconds as a reminder. 
A tap of any Fast-Play switch will play its message buffer one time. 
To auto-repeat, you must still use MSG as described on page 101.

    ELECRAFT® 
RS232 Interface Setup (PORT) 
 
Use the PORT menu entry to turn on 4800-baud RS232 
communication. When PORT is ON, tapping DISPLAY sends an 
"FA" command (VFO A frequency) for test purposes. Refer to the 
KIO2 or KPA100 manual for details. 
 
SPLIT/RIT/XIT Configuration (SPLT)          
 
Normally, the K2's SPLIT, RIT, and XIT selections stay the same as 
you switch from one band to the next. To have these selections stored 
on a per-band basis and retained when power is off, set SPLT to 
PER (per-band).  
 
10 and 12 m Power Limit in SSB/RTTY Modes (Po28)    
 
The highest distortion-free single-sideband power output level may be 
less than 15 watts, especially on 10 and 12 m. We recommend leaving 
Po28 at 10.0 watts. (Does not apply to CW mode.) 
 
RTTY/Data Mode (RTTY)    
 
RTTY/Data mode (mode letter lower-case r), if enabled, provides four 
independent crystal filter settings for use with data modes. To enable 
RTTY/Data mode, set the RTTY menu parameter to ON. The MODE 
list will then include C, L, U and r. r-NORMAL mode uses lower 
sideband, and r-REVERSE (with a "bar" over the r) uses upper 
sideband. To select r-REVERSE, hold the CW RV switch. (FINE RIT 
is also very useful in data modes; see page 106). 
 
Filter configuration (CAL FIL):  r mode defaults to the same 
settings as LSB and USB. Use CAL FIL (on 17 meters or below) to 
modify the r-mode filter bandwidths or BFO settings as needed. 
 
Speech compression (SSBCr): The SSBC menu entry will change 
to SSBCr when r mode is selected. A setting of 1-1 (1:1, or speech 
compression off) is recommended for RTTY/data. 
Real-Time Clock (RTC) 
 
If RTC is set to ON and a KAF2 or KDSP2 option is installed, the 
DISPLAY  switch can access a time or date display. (The KDSP2 also 
provides DSP features which are accessible via the DISPLAY switch.) 
Refer to the KAF2 or KDSP2 manual. 
 
RIT/XIT Range Selection (RIT)     
 
 
RIT is used to select one of four RIT/XIT OFFSET ranges. If the 
selected range is +/- 1.2 kHz or higher, the RIT/XIT annunciators 
flash whenever RIT or XIT are turned on. 
 
Accessory Outputs (ACC) 
 
This menu entry can be used in conjunction with the Elecraft KRC2 
programmable band decoder to control equipment external to the K2. 
Refer to the KRC2 manual for details. 
  
Extended VFO Range (D19) 
 
Leave D19 set to the default, n (no), unless you have installed 
varactor diodes D19 and D20 in conjunction with the K60XV option 
(60 meters plus low-level transverter I/O). At that time the parameter 
should be set to Y.  
 
Note: Do not install D19 and D20 until the K60XV option is 
installed. 
  
K2/100 Mode Selection (PA)      
 
If you have the KPA100 option installed, the PA menu entry shows 
the 100-watt stage's operating mode. While editing the PA parameter, 
tapping  DISPLAY  selects the fan mode (nor, LoHi, Hi). For more 
details, refer to the KPA100 manual (Appendix G of the K2 owner's 
manual, which is supplied with the KPA100 kit).

Transverter Bands (TRN1-TRN6)       
Six user-definable bands are provided for use with transverters. Once 
enabled individually using the TRN1-3 / 4-6 menu entries, these 
bands will appear in the band rotation following 10 meters. You can 
use Elecraft XV-Series transverters and most other transverter types 
with the K2.  
Transverter switching: Up to six Elecraft XV-Series transverters can 
be controlled automatically using the K60XV option (60 meter adapter 
and low-level transverter I/O). Refer to the K60XV manual for further 
details. 
Transverter configuration: These bands are set up using the TRN1-
3/4-6 menu entries. First, tap MENU, select the secondary menu 
(SEC) using  DISPLAY , and scroll to TRN1, 2, or 3. (Tapping  
ANT1/2  switches to TRN4-6.) Next, hold EDIT to highlight the first 
parameter. You can then tap DISPLAY to rotate through the 
parameters. Finally, change parameters as needed using the VFO knob 
or BAND+ / BAND- . Changes take effect when you exit EDIT mode.

19 When you first select a different I.F., the displayed A and B VFOs may end 
up outside the intended RF band. To correct this, tune the VFO up or down to 
the desired frequency, or use direct frequency entry. 
Using transverter bands: When you switch to a transverter band 
(using BAND+ / BAND-), the message TRN1, 2 or 3 is flashed. 
The LCD shows up to 999 MHz by shifting one place to the right. 
Note: If you select 10 Hz tuning steps with RATE, the hundreds of 
MHz digit will briefly disappear so you can see the 10-Hz digit.  
Direct Frequency Entry on transverter bands is in-band only. For 
bands over 99 MHz, the first digit is made part of the prompt. For 
example, on a transverter band in the 430 MHz range, you'd see 
 - - - - 4 when you hold BAND+ and BAND- together to initiate 
Direct Frequency Entry. To get to 432.100 MHz, you'd then enter 
32100. 
Controlling transverter relays: The 8R HOLD feature can prevent 
excessive transverter relay switching in CW mode. To change the 8R 
HOLD setting, locate the T-R menu entry (primary menu), edit the 
parameter, and tap DISPLAY to select 8r hold. (This is the default 
setting and is recommended for use in all operating modes, whether or 
not transverters are used.) 
Using the K60XV option with transverters: In addition to 60 meter 
coverage, the K60XV option provides a low-level, split RX/TX path 
transverter interface. This interface can be selected on a per-
transverter-band basis by adjusting the OUT field for an output value 
in milliwatts (L0.01-L1.27). In TUNE mode, power in mW is 
displayed, plus LP for "low power" (e.g. P1.00 LP). 
The K60XV also provides a buffered relay keying output, and logic 
outputs for transverter switching. Additional control capabilities are 
available with the Elecraft KRC2 programmable band decoder. (Refer 
to the K60XV and KRC2 manuals.) 
ATU considerations: Use caution when connecting both a 
transverter and an HF antenna to the KAT2: you could accidentally 
transmit at high power into the transverter. For example, suppose 
that you have TRN1 set up for an I.F. of 14 MHz and a 1.0-watt 
power limit. If you switch the K2 to 14 MHz--where there is no power 
limit--you must remember not to transmit into the KAT2 antenna jack 
that is connected to the transverter.

9. Circuit Details 
Before reading this section you should become familiar with the Schematics 
(Appendix B) and Block Diagram (Appendix C). 
 
System Overview 
 
The K2’s modular design allows flexibility in configuration and provides for 
future expansion. At the core of this modular architecture are the three main 
circuit boards:  
 
Front Panel 
 
User interface, including display and controls 
Control Board  
 
MCU, DC control, AGC, and AF amplifier 
RF Board 
 
All RF circuitry, relays, and I/O controller (IOC) 
 
This functional division allows related circuits to be grouped together, but 
also provides a high degree of isolation between the analog and digital 
sections of the transceiver. The RF board serves as a "mother board," while 
the front panel and Control boards plug into the RF board at its front edge. 
The front panel and Control boards are mounted back-to-back, with their 
ground-plane layers forming a partial enclosure that helps minimize radiated 
digital noise.  
 
The K2’s custom enclosure is also modular. It is fabricated in six pieces, with 
a unique 2-D fastener used at each joint and also for PCB support. This 
design provides a rugged but light-weight enclosure that is ideal for field or 
home use.  
 
The top cover, which includes the upper portion of the rear panel, can support 
a variety of built-in options such as an internal battery, automatic antenna 
tuner, and RS-232 interface. The top cover can be replaced with a 100 W 
power amplifier module, converting the K2 into a medium-power station. 
Signal Flow 
 
The block diagram (Appendix C) shows overall signal flow in the K2. 
Transmit and receive paths are shown for sideband operation. For CW 
transmit, the BFO signal is routed directly to the transmit mixer.  
 
The K2 receiver is a single-conversion superhet, utilizing double-tuned band-
pass filters on each band and down-conversion to a low I.F (4.915 MHz). 
This approach results in excellent CW and SSB performance. The low I.F. is 
compatible with narrow, variable-bandwidth CW crystal filtering and allows 
the use of fast I.F.-derived AGC. An I.F. of 4.915 MHz also results in nearly 
no birdies across all nine bands. The BFO is microcontroller controlled to 
allow upper and lower sideband reception on any band, as well as CW on 
either sideband. AM signals can be received in SSB modes thanks to the 
stable VFO, although AM transmit is not currently supported. 
 
Individual (per-band) band-pass filters offer improved intermodulation 
performance when compared to up-conversion designs that use only a single 
low-pass filter to remove image products ahead of the receiver. Up-
conversion also requires the use of a second I.F. to obtain good CW 
performance, increasing cost and producing additional spurious signals. (An 
alternative is up-conversion followed directly by a product detector and audio 
filter. While this results in minimal parts count, it was not considered since 
the resulting CW and AGC performance would have been poor.) 
 
On transmit signal flow is reversed, so the BFO is combined with the VCO to 
generate an output at the operating frequency, which is filtered by the band-
pass and low-pass filters. A highly stable power amplifier chain up to 10-15 
watts on all bands, and the output level can be set in 0.2-W increments (0.1–
W increments below 10 W). The transmit strip is conservatively rated to 
provide excellent reliability and immunity to high SWR. High-isolation PIN-
diode T-R switching is used to provide silent, no-relays QSK. (Please refer to 
the RF Board section for further details.)

Coverage of 160-10 meters is provided by a single wide-range VCO (voltage-
controlled oscillator). High-side and low-side injection are both used, 
depending on the band, so the overall VCO range is limited to about 6 to 24 
MHz. Only one VCO is needed, with a single high-Q inductor and three small 
DPDT relays configured to select one or more fixed capacitors. The VCO is 
driven by a PLL synthesizer. 5 kHz frequency steps are used at the PLL, 
while 10 Hz increments are provided by a 12-bit DAC driving an 11 MHz 
VCXO (PLL reference oscillator).  
 
Crystal Filters and BFO Settings 
 
The signals you tune in on the K2's receiver are "shaped" by the crystal filter, 
which passes only a narrow range of frequencies. The pitch of these signals is 
determined by the BFO (beat-frequency oscillator). Figure 9-1 shows an 
example of how these signals are related. The BFO frequency is below the 
filter passband; this is the case for the CW "normal" and LSB modes on the 
K2. Two different filters are shown: FL2 (narrow, for CW), and FL1 (wide, 
for LSB voice). Frequencies in the 4915 kHz range are shown because this is 
the K2’s intermediate frequency, or I.F.

BFO 
Signal 1
Signal 2
FL1 
 
Figure 9-1 CW Normal or LSB. 
In this example, filter FL2’s bandwidth is set for about 1 kHz, and it is 
centered at 4914.0 kHz. The BFO is set for 4913.0 kHz.  
Signal 1 (4914.0 kHz) will be passed by FL2, and you’ll hear it at an audio 
pitch of 1 kHz (4914-4913). Signal 2 (4915.0 kHz) will be rejected by FL2, 
but passed by FL1, and heard at 2 kHz. The same BFO setting can be used for 
both filters, because the lower boundary of the K2’s variable-bandwidth 
crystal filter stays fixed as it is made wider. Only the upper edge moves 
significantly. 
Figure 9-2 shows the BFO positioned above the same two filters, which will 
allow the K2 to receive USB and CW Reverse (opposite-sideband CW). 
Since the upper boundary of the filter moves as the filter is widened, the BFO 
frequency must move the same amount. BFO2 is used with FL2, and BFO1 is 
used with FL1.

The CAL FIL menu function provides the means to control how wide the 
filters are, and where the BFOs are located in relation to them. (The numeric 
parameters you select using CAL FIL are translated into voltages that 
control the filter and BFO by means of voltage-variable-capacitance diodes, 
or varactors.) 
 
Microcontroller (MCU) 
 
The K2’s microcontroller is an integral part of all transceiver operations. 
Firmware is used to advantage to provide many functions traditionally 
provided by discrete control logic. For example, the VCXO (PLL reference 
oscillator) is linearized on each band by a firmware auto-calibration routine, 
with resulting tables stored in EEPROM. Another example is firmware ALC, 
which is used on CW to maintain the user-specified power level across all 
bands. The SSB adapter, when installed, provides its own optimized hardware 
ALC. 
Extensive use of firmware also results in many useful operating features not 
usually found on transceivers in this price class. These features include built-
in test equipment (frequency counter and digital voltmeter), auto-calibration, 
dual VFOs, memories, split operation, RIT/XIT, and a versatile keyer. 
Provisions have also been made in firmware to support a wide range of option 
modules. (See full feature list elsewhere on the web site.)

Latching Relays 
Latching relays are used for all filter, VCO, and option switching, so there is 
no relay current drawn during normal operation. This, combined with careful 
power control at all stages in the transceiver, results in receive-mode current 
drain as low as 100 mA. The latching relays are all controlled by a single 
device, the I/O Controller (see below), which also handles other 
miscellaneous I/O tasks on the RF board. DPDT relays are used for all filter 
switching, reducing the number of relays needed by a factor of two. 50-ohm 
switching is used for all filters, and this combined with careful layout and 
guard-banding of the relays results in excellent filter input/output isolation. 
Co-Processors and the AuxBus 
In keeping with the K2’s modular system architecture, much of the I/O 
switching is handled by co-processors. There is only one co-processor in the 
basic K2, the I/O Controller (IOC). Some option modules, such as the SSB 
adapter, have their own co-processors. This distributed processing technique 
allows future modifications to be made to option boards without changing the 
transceiver itself. It also reduces cost of the basic K2, since fewer main-
processor control lines are needed.  
The IOC, as well as all co-processors on option modules, go into "sleep" 
mode with their own 4 MHz clocks suspended during normal operation. For 
this reason, there is virtually no digital noise on the RF board to cause 
receiver EMI.  
When the operator performs an operation that changes relay states, the main 
microcontroller (on the Control board) wakes up the co-processors and sends 
one of them a configuration command. These commands are transmitted on a 
one-wire network called the AuxBus. The AuxBus network line sits at a logic 
high during normal operation, and is only activated when needed. The 
receiver is muted during commands, so the operator never hears any digital 
noise due to AuxBus activity. 
Most AuxBus transmissions occur due to operator requests such as a band 
change. However, the AuxBus may also be used during transmit to relay 
numeric data such as SWR or ALC from a coprocessor to the main 
microcontroller. Waking up the coprocessors during transmit has no effect on 
the transmitted signal. 
 
Front Panel Board 
The front panel PC board plugs into the RF board via a 20-pin single-row 
connector, P1. The Front Panel is made up of a number of user-interface 
elements as detailed below.  
The LCD, DS1, is an 8-digit 7-segment transflective type with three 
backplanes (triplexed). Its driver, U1, receives display commands via an I2C 
interface.20 The LCD backlight LEDs, D2 and D3, are used to provide enough 
brightness to handle low-lighting situations ("NITE" mode in the menu), 
while drawing only a small amount of current (<30 mA). However, they can 
be turned off when ambient lighting is sufficient ("DAY" mode) because the 
LCD is transflective, i.e. it can either reflect or transmit light. The LCD 
displays the operating frequency and status messages, and also has 8 
annunciators which indicate the settings of various controls.  
A 10-segment LED bargraph, DS2, is used to display received and 
transmitted signal strength and ALC level. Using the menu, the operator can 
select OFF, DOT or BAR mode for the bargraph, with OFF or DOT modes 
typically used to save current during battery operation. U3 and U4 are 8-
output MOSFET driver arrays which control the bargraph, among other 
things. Q1 and Q2 form a brightness control. When the NIGHT(low) control 
line is pulled to ground by U3, the bargraph supply voltage drops to 2.7 V, 
resulting in about 6 mA/LED. The LCD backlight is also turned ON in this 
case. When NIGHT(low) is left high for daytime use, each LED draws about 
18 mA, and the LCD backlight is OFF. 
A high-quality optical shaft encoder, Z1, provides 100 counts per turn. VFO 
tuning steps of 10, 50, or 1000 Hz per increment are used, resulting in 1, 5 
and 100 kHz per turn, respectively. The encoder is also used to modify 
parameters in the menu. The encoder can be turned off by U3 to save current 
under certain operating conditions.  
S1-S16 are pushbutton switches. Switch data is read by U2, an 8-bit parallel-
to-serial shift register. Each switch has at least two functions: the top label 
corresponds to a TAP (short press) and the bottom label corresponds to a 
HOLD (long press, ~0.5s). Switch combinations are also supported, although 
only two are used (BAND+ and BAND- together enter direct frequency entry 
mode, and AGC with PRE/ATTN turns AGC on or off). 
                                                     
20 I2C stands for Inter-IC Communication, an industry standard serial 
interface protocol used by Philips and other IC manufacturers.

Potentiometers R1, R2 and R5 (Keyer Speed, Power Out, and RIT/XIT 
Offset) are multiplexed onto a single A-to-D input of the MCU, the "VPOTS" 
line, so their position can be read. Firmware hysteresis is used for these 
controls to prevent noise from interfering with the readings, with more 
hysteresis on transmit. The AF GAIN control is not read by the MCU; its 
leads go directly to the input of the AF amp on the Control Board. (The entire 
path from product detector to AF amp is balanced to prevent common-mode 
noise pickup—see Control Board for details.)  As is true of most modern 
transceivers, the RF GAIN control actually controls the receiver’s IF gain; it 
varies the DC control voltage on pin 5 of U12 (RF Board). 
 
The circuitry associated with J2, the mic jack, is only present if the SSB 
option is installed. P1 is a configuration header that the user can wire as 
needed to support any of several industry-standard microphones with an 8-pin 
circular connector. Q3 and its associated resistors are used to multiplex the 
UP, DOWN, and FUNCTION lines from P1 onto the VPOTS line to allow 
the mic to send commands to the MCU. The PTT line from the MIC activates 
the DOT-PTT line to initiate transmit. The MICAF line, mic audio output, is 
amplified and processed by circuitry on the SSB adapter (see Option 
Modules). 
 
Control Board 
 
The Control board plugs into the RF board via connectors P1, P2, and P3 
(along the bottom edge of the schematic). P1 handles the AGC signals while 
P2 provide miscellaneous I/O. Redundant connections are provided for 
ground, supply voltages, low-impedance signals (such as audio output) and a 
few other critical signals.  
 
U6 is a PIC18C452 microcontroller (MCU), with 8 k of EPROM, 300+ bytes 
RAM, serial I/O, parallel I/O, and A-to-D inputs. It is self-contained with the 
exception of its 4 MHz crystal oscillator, X2. Even when running at 4 MHz, 
the PIC processor is very efficient:  it only draws a few milliamps at 5 V. 
Also, since the program and data memories are located on-chip, there is very 
little noise radiation from the MCU. 
To get the most out of the available I/O on the MCU, much of the 
communication from MCU to the rest of the K2 is done via serial interfaces: 
 
RS232:   Used for communicating with a computer via P4 
 (Aux I/O) 
I2C:   
 
Display driver data 
SPI:   
 
The serial peripheral interface is used to access various 
peripherals, including the PLL and DACs. 
AuxBus:   
1-wire data network for co-processor control 
Shift registers:  
serial-to-parallel shift registers are used to access  
MOSFET LED drivers on the front panel; a parallel-to- 
serial shift register on the front panel is used for reading  
pushbuttons. 
 
In addition to the microcontroller the Control board provides a number of 
specialized hardware interfaces. Circuitry is described moving from left to 
right, top to bottom on the schematic. 
 
U10A and associated circuitry are used to accurately control power output as 
well as provide CW waveform shaping. The keying waveform is sigmoidal 
(S-shaped)  on both rising and falling edges in order to provide totally click-
free keying. 
 
Q9 and Q10 form a two-stage amplifier, supplying a square wave signal to 
the MCU when the frequency counter is enabled and a probe is connected to 
P6. The counter amp is turned off at all times except when one of the 
calibration routines is being used. 
 
The four outputs from the quad DAC (U8) provide: audio tones (via U10B), 
BFO frequency control (U10D), and crystal filter bandwidth control (U10C). 
Audio tone pitch, amplitude, and wave shape are controlled in firmware to 
yield clean sidetone from 400-800 Hz, as well as general-purpose tones. The 
bandwidth control line doubles as the transmitter driver bias control on 
transmit. 
 
Note:  The sidetone signal is actually generated at pin 4 of U8, which is a 
logic output, while sidetone volume is set by a D-to-A output of the DAC 
using Q5 as a variable-drain-voltage saturated switch. The DAC cannot be 
used to generate sidetone directly because the 60 dB channel-to-channel 
isolation is not adequate to prevent slight modulation of the VBFO and 
BVIAS lines on transmit.

U7 provides 2 kbytes of non-volatile configuration data storage. This memory 
is used for VCO lookup tables, CW messages, frequency memories and other 
variables that must be permanently saved. The EEPROM can be written 
millions of times without loss of data. During normal operation on a single 
frequency (such as when in a QSO), the EEPROM is not accessed at all. 
However, whenever the VFO is moved, a 30-second timer is triggered. Once 
the VFO has stopped moving for 30 seconds, the EEPROM is updated with 
the latest VFO frequency. In this way, the K2 always saves the most recent 
"important" frequency. (The EEPROM update also takes place any time you 
change bands or operating modes, etc., so you don’t have to wait for 30 
seconds to record an important configuration change.)  An alternative strategy 
used by many rigs is to use battery-backed-up RAM, continuously recording 
the operating frequency. We preferred to eliminate the backup battery, which 
often has a high failure rate and must be periodically replaced.  
 
The Control board provides a built-in voltmeter and ammeter. By jumpering 
P7 appropriately, the operator can monitor either the internal 12 V supply 
voltage or the voltage from a test probe plugged into P5. U3B buffers the DC 
signal from the probe, and also is used in conjunction with Q11 to provide 
supply current monitoring. The current sense resistor, which has a value of 50 
milliohms, is located on the RF board (R115). 
 
U4 is a low-dropout 8 V regulator, which is stable with a K2 input DC 
voltage as low as 8.2 V. Since all signal-generating and signal monitoring 
stages in the K2 run from this 8 V supply, the transceiver will function 
normally even when running from very depleted batteries; most transceivers 
use a higher regulated voltage for these stages and in some cases will not 
operate reliably even at a battery voltage of 11 V. (Transmit power will be 
scaled back and a warning message displayed if the battery voltage drops 
below a critical value or if current drain is excessive.)  U5 provides 5 V for 
logic circuits on the front panel and Control board, but this signal does not 
appear on the RF board, so noise is minimized. 
 
8 V Switching:  Q1 and Q2 provide stable +8 V sources on transmit (8T) and 
receive (8R). (Q23 on the RF board is used to guarantee that 8R goes to 0 V 
on receive to maintain proper reverse voltage on T-R switch diodes.) 
 
An optional audio filter module (KAF2 or KDSP2) can be mounted on the 
bottom of the Control board. These options provide analog or digital filtering 
functions. The audio filter module has its own co-processor. 
 
Q6 and Q7 disconnect the AF amplifier from the product detector on transmit, 
which is necessary for clean QSK. U9 is an LM380 audio amp IC, supplying 
approximately 1W of audio drive to a 4-ohm speaker in the cover of the K2. 
Sidetone is injected post-volume control so that sidetone and receiver audio 
volume can be controlled independently. 
 
The AGC circuit is the only RF stage located on the Control board. 
Mixer/oscillator U1 generates a low-level signal at about 5.068 MHz, then 
mixes it with the 4.915 MHz I.F. signal from the RF board to produce a new 
auxiliary I.F. of about 150 kHz. This auxiliary I.F. signal is then amplified by 
U2B and detected by D1 to create a positive-going AGC voltage, which is 
then routed back to the RF board to control the I.F. amp (U12). While it is 
possible to generate the same AGC voltage by simply amplifying and 
detecting the 4.915 MHz signal itself, this technique often necessitates 
shielding of the AGC RF amplifier stages to prevent radiation of the I.F. or 
BFO signals back into the receiver I.F. strip. We obtain all of the gain at 150 
kHz instead, so the 4.915 MHz signal is not re-radiated. 150 kHz is high 
enough to obtain fast AGC response—two orders of magnitude faster than is 
possible when audio-derived AGC is employed.  
 
RF Board 
The RF board is the largest of the three K2 boards, and serves as a structural 
element that the chassis and the other boards attach to. This board contains all 
of the RF circuits (amplifiers, oscillators, filters, etc.). Refer to the RF board 
schematic (Appendix B). 
Sheet 1:  Synthesizer 
The K2 uses a PLL (phase-locked-loop) synthesizer IC (U4) in conjunction 
with a wide-range, band-switched VCO (Q18). The synthesizer provides 
approximately +7 dBm output from 6 to 24 MHz, which is then injected at the 
transmit and receive mixers (sheet 2). Phase noise performance of the 
synthesizer is very good despite its low parts count and absence of shielding. 
The reference oscillator for the PLL IC is temperature-compensated by the 
components on the thermistor PC board. This circuit works by applying a 
variable offset voltage to varactor diodes D16 and D17 to compensate for 
drift As temperature increases, the uncompensated oscillator would drift 
down in frequency.  The thermistor causes a slight increase in the bias voltage 
to these diodes as the temperature increases. The relative values of RA-RD 
and the thermistor, Rt, (see below) set the rate of gain change with 
temperature.

U4 provides coarse tuning (5 kHz steps). Fine steps are achieved using a 12-
bit DAC (U5) to tune a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (Q19), which is 
the PLL reference oscillator. The reference oscillator range needed on each 
band varies in proportion to the VCO output frequency. To cover exactly 5 
kHz in 10 Hz steps on each band, an automatic calibration routine is provided 
in firmware. The DAC is swept from its highest output voltage down, and the 
DAC word needed to select each 100 Hz step is recorded in EEPROM on a 
per-band basis. 10 Hz steps are then interpolated based on the 100 Hz table 
data. Crystal X1 in the PLL reference oscillator can be tuned by varactor 
diodes D16 and D17 over a range of about 10 kHz, which is required in order 
to tune the full 5 kHz on the lowest band (160 m), but still provides better 
than 10 Hz resolution on the highest bands. 
The synthesizer design is unique in that three inexpensive DPDT latching 
relays are used to select one of eight VCO ranges, thus requiring only a single 
high-Q VCO inductor (T5). The relays are optimally interconnected to allow 
for maximum coverage of the nine HF bands, plus a large out-of-band tuning 
range. Computer simulation was used to find a relay topology that allowed for 
the use of standard 5% fixed capacitors along with the smallest practical 
varactor diode capacitance. As a result, the VCO exhibits low noise on all 
bands and has a low max/min tuning ratio on each band.  
In order to provide some allowance for unit-to-unit variance in T5, a much 
higher value slug-tuned inductor (L30) is placed across T5’s high-impedance 
winding. L30 has only a small effect on the Q of T5, but provides about a 
20% tuning range. The combined parallel inductance is very small (only 1 
µH), resulting in a very large C/L ratio on the lowest bands.  
U3 buffers the VCO signal. Q16/Q17 provide stable ALC to keep the VCO 
voltage fairly constant over the entire frequency range despite variations in 
the VCO transistor, Q18. 
Also shown on sheet 1 is the DC input circuitry (bottom right-hand corner), 
which is designed to protect the K2 and its power supply from almost any 
conceivable mis-connection or short. D10 protects the K2 from reverse 
polarity at the DC input, while dropping only 0.1-0.2 volt. F1 is a thermal 
self-resetting fuse that goes into a high-resistance state if a short or other 
high-current situation exists anywhere inside the K2. F1 resets quickly once 
the source of the short is removed. D12 provides reverse-polarity  protection 
for the internal battery, if applicable. 
Sheet 2: Receiver and Low-Level Transmitter Circuits 
The receiver is a single-conversion superhet with an I.F. (intermediate 
frequency) of 4.915 MHz. The preamp and attenuator are switched in using 
latching relays so that no current is required except when switching them on 
or off. The mixer is a diode ring type, providing good dynamic range (Z6), 
and is followed by a strong post-mixer amplifier, Q22. The current drain in 
Q22 can be reduced by the operator using a menu option that turns off Q12. 
A 5-pole variable-bandwidth crystal filter is used on CW (X7-X11). This 
filter is optimized for use at low bandwidths (~200 to 500 Hz), but can be set 
both narrower and wider as needed with only a small additional loss. The 
shape factor and passband ripple content are optimized at around 300 Hz. (On 
SSB, a separate fixed filter is switched in; this filter is located on the SSB 
adapter.)   
AGC is derived from the output of the I.F. amp by using an auxiliary, low-
frequency I.F. of about 150 kHz (see Control Board). The AGC signal is then 
applied to pin 5 of the I.F. amp (U12).  
A second crystal filter (X6/X5) follows the I.F. amp to reduce wideband 
noise. This filter is also tunable. Varactor diode D39’s capacitance is 
increased during CW use, but on SSB is reduced, making the response quite 
broad. Q25 turns on only if the optional SSB adapter is installed and its fixed-
bandwidth "OP1" filter is selected. This pulls capacitor C179 to ground, 
which interacts with L34 to shift the second crystal filter's center frequency so 
that it matches that of the OP1 filter. 
The product detector is a Gilbert-cell mixer/oscillator (U11). Due to the loss 
in the second crystal filter, the input voltage to U11 never exceeds the range 
that the device can handle.  
U11 also provides the BFO signal, which is tunable over about a 4 to 5 kHz 
range by varactor diodes D37 and D38. X3 and X4 have carefully-controlled 
characteristics and are well matched. As in the PLL VCXO (Q19, sheet 1), 
the two crystals de-Q each other to increase the tuning range of the BFO. 
On transmit, the BFO buffer/attenuator (Q24) is turned on. Q24’s drain 
voltage is controlled by the microcontroller, providing BFO amplitude 
control. Precision PIN diode D36 provides additional reduction in low-level 
signal leakage when Q24 is turned off. U10 mixes the VCO with the BFO on 
transmit, and video amplifier U9 increases the signal level while providing a 
low-impedance output to drive the bandpass filters (sheet 3).

    ELECRAFT® 
Sheet 3: Filters and I/O Controller 
The band-pass and low-pass filters are switched with latching relays to 
minimize loss and current drain. Only five band-pass filters and seven DPDT 
relays are required to cover nine bands (160-10 m). This is accomplished by 
switching fixed capacitors in or out using two additional relays. For example, 
on 160 meters, relay K3 places C13 and C14 across the 80 m band-pass filter. 
But relay K3 also used to switch the 20 meter band-pass filter to 30 meters by 
shorting C21 and C23 to ground. K6 places C32/C34 across the 15 m 
inductors to select 17 meters, or C44/C46 across the 10 m inductors to select 
12 meters. The band-pass response is a compromise on 80 and 160 meters but 
on all other bands is similar to what would be obtained with separate filters.  
The low-pass filters also serve double-duty in most cases; five filters cover 8 
bands (80-10 m). The 30/20 m filter uses three pi-sections to provide good 
roll-off of the 20 MHz second harmonic when operating on 30 meters. Most 
of the filters are elliptic, aiding attenuation of specific harmonics. But elliptic 
filters are not needed on 40 and 80 meters since these each cover only one 
band. The 2nd harmonic attenuation provided by the push-pull power 
amplifier is quite good even pre-filter (sheet 4).  
DPDT relays are used for the low-pass and band-pass filters rather than the 
traditional SPDT approach which requires twice as many relays. This is 
possible by virtue of careful guard-banding techniques on both top and 
bottom of the PC board in the filter areas. Isolation between input and output 
of each filter is excellent across the entire frequency range. 
The T-R switch (D1-D5) provides very high isolation using low-cost silicon 
diodes with a PIN characteristic (1N4007). Q2 is a very high-voltage 
MOSFET that provides a ground path on receive for D3 and D4, but on 
transmit this transistor can easily handle the high voltages present on the 
power amplifier collectors. 
U1, a 28-pin PIC microcontroller (16F872 or 16F872A), drives all of the 
latching relays and a few other I/O lines. U1 is referred to it as the I/O 
controller (IOC) because it handles nearly all I/O functions for the main 
microcontroller. It also has the job of determining whether the 160 
m/RXANT option board is installed by sensing the presence or absence of the 
two relays on the module. Finally, the IOC contains all of the per-band and 
per-memory initialization data in ROM, which is sent to the main 
microcontroller as needed to initialize EEPROM data tables. A number of 
different regional band plans and other customized parameters can be 
accommodated in U1’s data tables. 
 
The latching relays are wired with a single common drive line so that when 
one relay needs to be turned on or off, the others are pulled in the opposite 
direction. This arrangement requires no drivers of any kind. U1’s I/O lines are 
protected from relay transients by its own internal shottky clamping diodes to 
6 V and ground. Measured transients are well within the current rating of the 
clamping diodes. Transients are reduced in amplitude by the series resistance 
of the other non-switched relays and U1’s own MOSFET driver impedance. 
The relays are rated at 5 V nominal (250-ohm coils). The actual impressed 
voltage is in the 5 V to 6 V range, depending on ambient temperature, 
reflecting the best and worst-case sink/source current limits of the 16F872. 
The IOC communicates with the main microcontroller over the 1-wire 
AuxBus. U1’s 4 MHz clock is turned off and the device is in sleep mode at all 
times, except when it is processing an AuxBus message, so there is no digital 
noise on receive.  The main microcontroller runs from a 5 V supply, while the 
IOC runs from 6 V. The AuxBus is designed to accommodate devices 
running at both voltage levels. 
Sheet 4: Transmitter Amplifier 
Q5 and Q6 are class-A pre-driver and driver stages, respectively. Q5’s bias is 
provided directly by the 8 V transmit line (8T), while Q6’s bias is switched 
on by the 8T line but is gated by Q10. This is necessary because the DAC 
output that supplies the bias voltage for the driver is used as the crystal filter 
bandwidth control voltage on receive. The bias to Q6 can be varied under 
firmware control to optimize efficiency for CW vs. SSB and at different 
output levels. This is useful in maintaining high overall efficiency during 
battery operation. 
Q7 and Q8 form a conservatively-rated push-pull power amplifier that can 
easily supply 10 watts or higher output on all bands. Q11 and Q13 are used as 
a bias voltage regulator. The bias regulator is effectively out of the circuit on 
CW because of the large size of resistor R62, resulting in approximately a 
class-B bias level. On SSB, resistor R63 is grounded by the I/O controller, 
causing much more current flow through Q13 and stabilizing the bias for 
class AB operation.

10. Options 
The K2 can be customized using a variety of internal and external options, 
which are briefly described here. Note: If you press a switch associated with 
a missing option module, you'll see NOT INST (not installed) on the 
LCD. Menu parameters for missing options will be displayed as "--". 
 
KSB2 SSB Adapter: The KSB2 allows the K2 to transmit and receive LSB 
and USB, which enables use of voice as well as PSK31, RTTY (AFSK), 
SSTV, and other data modes. VOX and PTT are supported, and power output 
can be set from about 0.5 to 15 watts (PEP). The adapter's crystal filter is 
optimized for SSB transmit and receive, but can also be used for CW or AM 
receive. Mic gain and speech compression level can be set using the menu. 
Our MH2 Heil/Elecraft hand mic is ideally suited to use with the KSB2. 
 
KNB2 Noise Blanker: The KNB2 is effective on a wide range of noise 
sources, and includes two gain settings as well as two different blanking pulse 
widths. The noise blanker is controlled using two dedicated front-panel 
functions, NB and LEVEL. 
 
KAT2 Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU): Our internal QRP ATU handles a 
wide range of impedances, tunes nearly any antenna–on any band–in seconds, 
and stores all data for instant band recall. Best of all, it includes an integral 
dual antenna switch (controlled by ANT1/2), providing the functionality of 
two antenna tuners in one. The KAT2 uses latching relays, so current drain is 
nearly zero except when an antenna is being tuned. 
 
KAT100 High-Power Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU): The KAT100 is a 
rugged, external ATU that's the ideal companion for the K2/100. It can handle 
up to 150 watts, and like the KAT2, provides two antenna jacks accessible 
with the ANT1/2 switch. The KAT100 offers the same matching range, 
menu control features, and display capabilities of the KAT2, and in addition 
offers 10 LEDs for real-time monitoring of SWR. Note: The KAT100 can be 
used with the basic K2 as well as the K2/100. The basic K2 must have the 
KIO2 option installed to control the tuner. 
K60XV 60-m Adapter and Transverter Interface:  The K60XV adds 60 
meter coverage  and a low-level, split RX/TX transverter interface (~0 dBm).  
 
K160RX 160 m Adapter and RX ANT Switch: The K160RX option adds 
160 meters a separate receive antenna switch. The receive antenna can have a 
separate preamp/attenuator setting from the normal antenna (per-band). 
 
KBT2 Internal 12-V Battery: The rechargeable battery fits snugly into the 
top cover along with the KAT2 ATU and/or KIO2. Recharging requires an 
external 14-V regulated power supply, which can also power the transceiver.  
 
KIO2 RS232 Interface: This option allows full computer control of the K2, 
and uses true RS232 signal levels. It works with most transceiver control and 
logging software, as well as our own k2remote and k2voice programs.  
 
KDSP2 or KAF2 Audio Filter and Real-Time Clock: The KDSP2 provides 
advanced DSP filtering, auto-notch, and noise reduction. The KAF2 provides 
analog low-pass and narrow CW band-pass functions. Both include time/date 
display and an on-board, long-life backup battery. 
 
KPA100 Internal 100-Watt Stage with RS232 I/O: The KPA100 completes 
the K2 as a 100 W PEP/CW transceiver. The kit comes with its own top 
cover/heat sink that replaces the K2's original top cover. The original top 
cover can be re-installed in about one minute for lightweight field operation. 
 
KRC2 Programmable Band Decoder: The KRC2 can be used to control 
antennas, amplifiers, transverters, filters, or other station equipment directly 
from the K2. Custom configuration is possible using a PC. 
 
XV-Series Transverters: Elecraft's transverters are an ideal match for the 
K2, providing high-performance receive and 20-25 watts output on 
VHF/UHF bands. The K2 can directly control up to six transverters.

Appendix E, Troubleshooting 
 
If you have any difficulty with your K2: 
 
 
Closely examine all PC boards for poor solder joints and incorrect, 
broken or missing components. 
 
Look for your problem in the Troubleshooting Tables (below). 
 
Follow the step-by-step receiver and transmitter Signal-Tracing 
procedures at the end of this section. Also included are complete DC 
Voltage Tables for all ICs and transistors. 
 
Troubleshooting Tables 
 
There are five troubleshooting tables (listed below). Within each table, 
problems are identified by 3-digit numbers in the ranges shown. In most cases 
you’ll know which table to look in based on the symptoms you observe. If in 
doubt, start with the General Troubleshooting table. 
 
General Troubleshooting  
000-049 
Control Circuits  
 
050-099 
Receiver 
 
 
100-149  
 
 
 
Transmitter 
 
 
150-199 
Operation and Alignment  
200-249 
 
When referring to components on the various K2 boards in the table, we will 
sometimes use a shorthand form such as “RF-U11,” which means U11 on the 
RF board. 
 
INFO Messages 
 
If you see a message such as  INFO 100 on the LCD, look up the  
corresponding entry in the troubleshooting tables. Note:  INFO messages 
can be cleared by pressing any switch. However, the cause of these messages 
should be investigated before continuing to operate the transceiver. 
 
General Troubleshooting (000-049) 
 
Problem 
Troubleshooting Steps 
000  Unit appears to be 
completely dead when 
power switch is turned 
on (no display, no 
audio) 
 
Make sure your power supply or battery is 
connected, turned on, and isn’t plugged in 
backwards 
 
Check power supply and battery fuses if 
applicable 
 
The K2’s internal self-resetting fuse, F1, may 
have gone into a high-resistance state due to 
a short from the 12-V line to ground; unplug 
the power supply and check for such shorts 
 
Examine power cable for shorts or opens  
 
Verify control board is plugged in and that its 
connectors are fully seated 
 
Check for 12 VDC at the power jack  
 
Make sure speaker, battery, and other internal 
option connectors are not swapped or 
plugged in backwards 
 
Measure the +5V and +8V regulated power 
supplies. If either is incorrect, check the 
regulators (050). 
 
Check the MCU (075) 
003  LCD is dim 
 
Check values of R16 and R15 on the front 
panel 
 
Check continuity from LCD driver (U1) to 
LCD. Also look for bent pins on driver. 
004  Display turns on 
but unit still appears 
functionally dead or is 
“running slowly” 
 
Check the MCU, Control-U6 (075) 
 
Verify that the control and front panel boards 
are plugged in correctly 
 
The MCU oscillator may be shorted out due 
to solder flux residue, especially if you used 
water-soluble flux solder (030) 
005  No display, but 
audio is OK 
 
Remove the bottom cover and verify that the 
front panel connector is properly mated with 
the RF board 
 
If the front panel is plugged in correctly but 
the problem still persists, check all LCD 
voltages and control lines (060)

 
P7 on the control board may be jumpered for 
ext. 12V. Move the jumper to the "12V" pos. 
 
Battery voltage may be below 10.5V. 
Recharge the battery as soon as possible. 
010  Battery voltage 
too low for proper 
voltage regulation 
 
If you saw INFO 010 on the LCD, your 
battery voltage is too low (< 8.5V). This 
usually happens on transmit when your 
battery is weak. Disconnect the battery from 
the K2 and measure its voltage; if the battery 
voltage quickly rises back to 11 or 12V, the 
K2 may be loading the battery down. But if 
the battery stays stabilizes at under about 10 
V when measured outside of the K2, it has 
become fully discharged or may be defective. 
 
If you suspect the K2 is pulling the voltage 
down, tap any button to clear the INFO 
message then use  DISPLAY to show the 
voltage and current drain. If the current drain 
is > 200 mA with no signal and the bargraph 
OFF, something is shorting either the 12V 
line or one of the regulators (050). 
011  No audio, but 
display is OK 
 
Make sure that a working antenna is 
connected; check audio filter option, antenna 
switch, tuner, SWR bridge, etc. 
 
See Receiver Troubleshooting (100) 
012  Display, VFO 
knob, switches, or 
potentiometers do not 
function correctly or 
are intermittent 
 
Front panel or control board may not be 
plugged in correctly  
 
Check the MCU (075) 
 
Check all regulated supply voltages (050) 
 
RP1 or RP2 on the front panel board may be 
installed backwards. 
015  Current drain 
excessive on receive  
 
Check receive-mode current drain (140) 
016  Current drain 
excessive on transmit 
 
Connect the K2 to a known 50 ohm load 
(preferably a dummy load); if current drain 
returns to normal, you probably have a 
mismatched antenna and will have to 
improve the match or reduce output power 
 
If you have set the power level control 
significantly above the level that the 
transmitter is capable of, current may 
increase significantly; try reducing the power 
setting or use CAL CUR to set up a 
current limit 
 
Use voltage/current monitor mode to see if 
the power supply voltage drops below 11V 
on transmit; if so, you may be exceeding the 
capability of your power supply or battery 
(025) 
 
If the supply voltage and antenna impedance 
are correct, the driver or PA transistors may 
not be operating efficiently (150) 
018  Supply voltage 
drops when K2 is 
turned on 
 
Use voltage/current monitor mode to see if 
the receive-mode current drain is too high 
(015) 
 
If voltage drops but current drain is normal, 
you probably have a power supply problem 
or a battery that is not fully charged (025); 
review power supply requirements 
(Specifications) 
019  Supply voltage 
drops too low when 
transmitter is keyed 
 
Use voltage/current monitor mode to see if 
transmit-mode current drain is too high (016) 
 
If voltage drops but current drain on transmit 
is normal, you probably have a weak battery 
or inadequate power supply (025) 
025  Battery won’t 
charge up to the 
correct voltage, or 
discharges too quickly 
 
Batteries must be charged using the right 
voltage or their usable life will be greatly 
reduced; if you have the K2 internal battery 
option, refer to the charging instructions in 
the option manual 
 
Battery life can be extended by reducing 
power output and by turning off selected 
features using the menu; see Operation 
 
Always disable the K2’s internal battery 
using the rear-panel battery on-off switch if 
you plan to use an external battery or a 
reduced-voltage power supply that is 
inadequate for charging purposes  
029  Small error in 
actual vs. displayed 
frequency 
 
Make sure your 4.000-MHz oscillator 
(control board, X2) is calibrated. Two 
methods are provided in the Operation 
section (Advanced Operating Features).

 
Make sure the bottom cover is installed when 
doing CAL FIL and CAL PLL. Also, if 
you calibrate at room temperature but operate 
the radio at much lower or higher 
temperatures, calibration will be worse. 
 
Re-do CAL FIL after calibrating the 
4.000–MHz oscillator 
 
Re-do CAL PLL after calibrating the 
4.000-MHz oscillator 
 
Use CAL FCTR with probe on TP1 and 
tune very slowly through about 10 kHz of 
VFO range; if you see any sudden jumps of > 
50 Hz over this range even after doing CAL 
PLL, your 12.096-MHz oscillator crystal may 
be defective (RF, X1). 
030  VFO frequency 
jumps or drifts, or 
operating frequency 
appears to be entirely 
incorrect 
 
You must align both the VCO and BFO using 
the CAL PLL and CAL FIL before 
operating the K2; otherwise the VFO cannot 
be tuned properly and the synthesizer may 
not be locked (see Operation as well as RF 
board Alignment and Test, Part II) 
 
Make sure the supply voltage is above 8.5V 
at all times or the 8V regulator may not 
function correctly. 
 
If you used solder with water-soluble flux, 
you may have conductive paths all over the 
PC boards. These can cause numerous 
problems with the VFO, BFO, and logic 
circuits (anything high impedance). Try 
cleaning the entire board with hot water and a 
Q-tip, or follow solder manufacturer’s 
recommendations (except immersion). 
 
If you used CAL FIL to change the BFO 
settings, make sure you placed the BFO on 
the correct side of the zero-pitch value for 
each operating mode (see Operation, Filter 
Settings) 
 
If you tune beyond the lock range of the 
VCO, the frequency will stop changing and 
may “hunt” near the end of this range. If you 
are in a range that the VCO should be 
capable of tuning, re-check VCO alignment 
(see RF board Alignment and Test, Part II) 
 
If the displayed frequency is “garbage,” see 
Resetting the Configuration to Defaults in 
Advanced Operating Features. 
Control Circuits (050-099)  
 
Problem 
Troubleshooting Steps 
050  Regulated 
voltage(s) incorrect 
 
Remove all option boards, since any one of 
them  might be causing a short on a regulated 
supply line 
 
Make sure that the DC input voltage at J3 is 
> 8.5 (the minimum voltage needed by the 
voltage regulators) 
 
If +5V is too low (< 4.5V) go to 052 
 
If +8V is too low (< 7.5V) go to 053
051  General problem 
with control circuits 
(switches, knobs, 
display, bargraph, T-R 
switching) 
 
 
Check all DC voltages using the voltage 
tables (later in this section). Start with the 
control board.  
 
If the problem involves the front panel, 
measure those voltages next. If the problem 
is with T-R switching, check the RF board 
voltages next. You may have RP1 or RP2 on 
the front panel board installed backwards. 
052  +5V too low  
(< 4.75V) 
 
Remove the front panel to see if it is was 
pulling the 5V line low. If not, the problem is 
likely to be on the control board.  
 
Pull the control board out and inspect the 
entire 5V line looking for heat-damaged 
components or shorts. The schematic can be 
used to identify components on the 5V line. 
 
Remove the microprocessor to see if it is 
loading the 5V line down.  
 
Unsolder the output pin of the 5V regulator 
and bend it up slightly to break contact with 
the PC board. If the voltage is still too low 
measured at the pin, replace the regulator.

                                                                          4 
053  +8V too low  
(< 7.5V) 
 
Inspect the entire 8V path on the RF and 
control boards. Look for heat-damaged 
components or solder bridges.  
 
Unsolder the output pin of the 8V regulator 
and bend it up slightly to break contact with 
the PC board. If the voltage is still too low 
measured at the pin, replace the regulator. 
 
There are a number of places where you can 
easily break the 8V line to eliminate parts of 
the circuit in your search for the problem. 
One example is RFC16 on the RF board. If 
you lift one end of this inductor it will 
disconnect the entire synthesizer from the 8V 
line. 
 
A number of circuits have resistors in series 
with the 8V line, for example R112 in series 
with the I.F. amplifier (U12). If you measure 
voltage on both sides of these resistors you 
may find a circuit that is drawing high 
current or is shorted. Example: If you 
measured 7V on one side of R112 and 3V on 
the other, it would indicate that U12 had a 
current drain of 180 mA, which is much too 
high (I = E/R = 4/22 = 0.18). 
060  No display on 
LCD 
 
If the bar-graph is also not working, check 
the 5V regulator (052) 
 
Remove the front panel hardware and panel 
from the front panel PC board and inspect the 
entire board for shorts or incorrect 
components. You may have LCD driver U1 
in backwards or it may have a bent pin.  
 
Check the values of R15 and R16 on the 
bottom of the board; these resistors set the 
voltage for the LCD itself. 
 
Re-install the front panel board and turn on 
the K2. Using a voltmeter, measure the 
voltages on pins 16 and 17 of front panel 
connector J1 (ICLK and IDAT). These lines 
should show DC voltages between 0 and 5V 
due to data transmission from the 
microprocessor to the LCD driver. If the 
voltages are fixed at either 0 V or 5V rather 
than being somewhere in-between, the MCU 
may not be functioning (075) 
065  Relay Problem 
 
If you suspect a ground short in any relay-
controlled circuit (LPF, BPF, VCO) you can 
simplify debugging by pulling out the control 
board, then turning power ON and back OFF. 
This places all relays in the RESET condition 
(see schematic). 
 
If you hear no relays on power-up, check the 
IOC (080) 

============================================================

                                                                          5 
075  Possible MCU 
problem 
 
Measure the voltage on pin 32 of the MCU 
(U6, control board). If it is not 5V, check the 
5V regulator (052). 
 
Remove the control board and carefully 
inspect the microprocessor. Make sure it is 
not installed backwards, has no bent pins, and 
is seated firmly in its socket. 
 
Verify that the MCU oscillator components 
all have the correct values and are soldered 
properly, with no shorts (X2, C21, C22). 
 
Listen for the 4-MHz oscillator signal using 
another ham-band receiver. If you can't hear 
the signal, try putting a 1M resistor across X2 
on the control board. Also try rotating C22. 
080  IOC Problem 
 
If you saw the message INFO 080, the 
I/O controller (IOC, RF-U1) or other auxBus 
device did not respond to messages from the 
main processor (MCU). Turn power OFF and 
back ON; if you hear some relays switching 
on power-up, the IOC may be OK, and the 
problem is likely to be with the AuxBus 
(081) 
 
If you do not hear any relays switching on 
power-up, your IOC (RF-U1) may be 
defective. Inspect U1 carefully to see if you 
have installed it backwards or if any pins are 
bent. 
 
Pull U1 out, check its pins, then re-install it, 
making sure all pins make good contact with 
the IC socket. Check the 4-MHz oscillator 
(075). 
 
Remove the bottom cover and verify that all 
pins of U1’s socket are soldered, as well as 
those of the 6V regulator (RF-U2), and U1’s 
4 MHz oscillator (RF-Z5). 
 
With power ON, check all voltages 
associated with U1. You should see 6V at 
pins 1 and 20 at all times, even when the IOC 
is sleeping (not being accessed by the MCU). 
081  AuxBus problem 
 
You may have an option board installed that 
is causing a problem with the AuxBus. Try 
removing each option board and turning 
power off and back on. 
 
Verify that R64 is installed (RF board, near 
U1). 
 
Check the voltage at pin 1 of the IOC (RF, 
U1). If it isn’t approximately 6V, U2 may be 
bad (6V regulators). 
 
Check the voltage at pin 28 of the IOC (RF–
U1). It should be between 5 and 6V. If it is 
zero volts, you probably have a short 
somewhere on the AuxBus line. Turn power 
OFF, then measure pin 28 of U1 to ground. If 
it is a short, pull the control board out to see 
if the short is on that board. 
 
If the voltage at pin 28 is between 5V and 
6V, try pressing the BAND+ button a 
number of times while watching the voltage 
carefully (use an oscilloscope if possible). 
The voltage should drop below 5V briefly if 
the MCU (CTRL-U6) is sending a message 
to the IOC. If the voltage does not change at 
all, the MCU itself may not be sending 
AuxBus messages.  
 
Check the AuxBus signal at the MCU, pin 40 
(CTRL-U6). If you don’t see this voltage 
drop below 5V briefly when the band is 
changed, the MCU may not be functioning 
(075). 
090  EEPROM test  #1 
failed 
 
091  EEPROM test #2 
failed 
 
If you saw the message INFO 090 or 
INFO 091 on the LCD, one of the 
EEPROM write tests has failed.  
 
Check all voltages on the EEPROM (CTRL-
U7).  
 
Remove the control board and inspect U7 and 
surrounding traces. Verify that U7 is properly 
soldered.

Receiver (100-149) 
 
Problem 
Troubleshooting Steps 
100  Low (or no) audio 
output from receiver, 
or general receiver 
gain problem 
 
If you hear audio output on some bands but 
not all of them, check the band-pass and low-
pass filters and T-R switch (120) 
 
Make sure you have headphones or speaker 
connected, and AF GAIN not at minimum 
 
Check for missing audio filter option 
(KDSP2 or KAF2) or their bypass jumpers 
 
Check the key jack for a short to ground 
 
Make sure RF GAIN is at maximum 
 
The AGC threshold control (R1, Control 
board) may be set incorrectly. Typical  
voltage at U2 pin 5 is 3.80 volts (no antenna, 
RF GAIN at max). You can set R1 for a 
slightly higher voltage at U2 pin 5 to increase 
the no-signal I.F. gain. If R1 is adjusted, 
you'll need to re-adjust CAL S HI and CAL S 
LO (S-meter). 
 
If you have the 160 m/RXANT option board 
installed, you may have menu entry RANT 
turned ON but no receive antenna connected; 
this may affect only one band since RANT 
can be set individually for each band. 
 
Peak the band-pass filters if you have not 
already done so 
 
Check for ground shorts in the LPF and BPF 
by first resetting all of the relays (065) 
 
Turn the AF GAIN to maximum 
 
If you don’t hear any “hiss” at the receiver 
output, troubleshoot the AF amplifier (110) 
 
Check the 8V regulated supply voltage and 
troubleshoot if necessary (053) 
 
Measure the 8R line (+8V receive) at the 
anode of D6 on the RF board. It should be 8V 
+/- 0.5V. If not, look for a problem in the 8V 
switching circuitry (control board). 
 
Try using signal tracing (see procedure later 
in this section) 
110  AF amp not 
working 
 
Use the menu to set a sidetone level of 60 
(ST L 060). Hold SPOT. If you hear a 
strong tone, the A.F. amplifier itself is 
probably working; check the mute circuit 
(CTRL-Q6 and Q7) and trace the volume 
control lines back to the product detector 
(RF-U11)  
 
Remove the control board and inspect the 
entire A.F. amplifier and mute circuit for 
mis-installed components, shorts, and opens 
114  AGC or S-meter 
not working 
 
 
If AGC appears to be working but the S-
meter isn’t, try re-calibrating the meter using 
CAL S HI and CAL S LO. If the S-
meter is “stuck,” you may have an open, 
short, or incorrect component in the area of 
U2 on the control board. 
 
Make sure the RF gain control is at 
maximum 
 
If the AGC and S-meter are both not 
working, you may have a dead 5.068 MHz 
oscillator crystal, X1 (control board). Listen 
for the 2nd harmonic of  X1 at about 10.136 
MHz while touching a screwdriver  blade to 
pin 7 of U1 (NE602). If you can’t hear this 
signal, try soldering a 22 k resistor from pin 7 
to pin 3 on U1 (NE602). 
120  Signal loss only 
on some bands 
 
If you have the 160 m/RXANT option 
installed, make sure you have menu entry 
rANT set to OFF, or if it is ON that you 
have a receive antenna connected 
 
If K60XV option connectors are installed 
(J13 and J15 on RF board), but the module is 
removed, install C6 and W6. 
 
Peak appropriate band-pass filters 
 
Inspect T-R switch components and voltages 
 
Trace signal from band-pass filters to the 
antenna using an RF signal generator 
 
Make sure the VCO is oscillating on affected 
bands by using the frequency counter

140  Receiver current 
drain is too high 
 
If you saw the message INFO 140, your 
receive-mode current drain was measured at 
over 500 mA during normal operation. 
Continue with the checks below. 
 
Use DISPLAY to show voltage and current 
on the LCD. If the current shown is > 300 
mA with no incoming signal or > 200 mA 
with the bargraph turned OFF and no signal, 
you may have a short or excessive load on 
the 8V or 8R lines (053). 
 
You may have the speaker and/or external 
speaker jack wired incorrectly. This can place 
a short across the audio amp output, causing 
very low audio output (if any) and current as 
high as 500 to 800 mA. 
Transmitter (150-199) 
 
Problem 
Troubleshooting Steps 
150  General 
Transmitter problem 
 
If power output is too low, go to 155 
 
If power output slowly increases during key-
down, go to 160 
 
If current drain on transmit is too high for the 
given power level or you see HI CUR, go to 
175 
 
If the transmitter output power seems to be 
unstable go to 160 
 
If the transmitter stops transmitting by itself 
go to 170 
 
If the keyer isn’t working properly, go to 180 
 
Use the signal tracing procedure  
155  Power output is 
low or zero 
 
You may have CAL CUR (current limit) set 
too low; 2.00 A recommended at 10 W 
 
Check power output when using a 50Ω 
dummy load; if the output is correct on a 
dummy load but not when using an antenna, 
your antenna is probably not matched 
 
Install the bottom cover (all six screws)  to 
prevent RF pick-up by low-level circuits 
 
Check all component values in the RF 
detector; you may have two resistors 
swapped (R67/R68, R66/R69) or the wrong 
detector diode (D9, should be 1N5711) 
 
You may have a short in the LPF or BPF; 
reset all of the relays before trying to look for 
shorts (065) 
 
Examine transformers T1-T4 carefully; these 
must be wound as indicated in part III of the 
RF board assembly section (see this section 
for drawings) 
 
Check all DC voltages in the transmitter (RF 
board, Q5/Q6/Q7/Q8) as well as the ALC 
circuitry (control board, U10A and RF board, 
Q24).  
 
One component that should be checked 
specifically is R50 (driver), which can open 
if the driver current goes too high. 
 
Make an RF probe and signal-trace through 
the transmitter to find where signal is lost 
(see probe and procedure later in this section) 
 
Check for any components getting hot  
 
Turn the K2 OFF and remove the heat sink; 
inspect all parts and check for shorts or opens 
160  Power output 
fluctuates 
 
If you stay in key-down (TUNE) mode for 
several seconds, it is normal to see some 
increase in power; this is due to slow junction 
heating in the final amplifier transistors. It is 
not indicative of a problem unless current 
drain is too high for the given power output. 
 
If power goes up and down significantly 
during normal keying, you may have a 
poorly-matched antenna OR you may have 
power set too high for your battery or power 
supply to handle; try reducing power to see if 
it stabilizes 
 
If you have seen a slow (10-20Hz) oscillation 
superimposed on the transmitter's output 
signal, it could be due to ALC modulation. 
Increase the value of R98 (RF board) to the 
largest size that permits full output on 10 m.  
 
If the transmitter is truly unstable

(oscillating) even when connected to a 50-Ω 
load, you may have an incorrect component 
value or a toroid-winding error; go through 
the checks at 155   
 
Make sure none of the diodes in the T-R 
switch circuits are in backwards 
170  Output power 
drops to zero suddenly  
 
If you have transmit power set too high for 
your battery or power supply, the supply 
voltage may drop so low on transmit that it 
resets the MCU (CTRL-U6) or the I/O 
controller (RF-U1). Reduce power. 
175  Current drain too 
high on transmit (or 
HI CUR warning) 
 
You may have power set higher than the final 
amplifier can achieve, resulting in overdrive 
of all transmitter stages. Try reducing power 
to see if normal current drain is observed at 
lower power levels 
 
Damaged PA transistors or other components 
could cause inefficiency in any stage of the 
transmitter. Check all DC voltages and 
components; signal trace if necessarily (155)  
180  Keyer Problem 
 
 
If the keyer is stuck at a fixed speed or the 
sidetone pitch won’t change, go into  the 
menu and see what sidetone pitch your have. 
If it’s not in the range of 0.40-0.80 kHz, you 
may have bad data in the EEPROM. See 
“Resetting the Configuration to Defaults” in 
the Advanced Operating Features section. 
 
If the keyer is generally erratic when 
transmitting and seems to get worse as power 
is increased, you probably have RF leaking 
into the keyline. Try bypassing your key with 
.001 µF capacitors; also try 100 µH RF 
chokes in series with the paddle and ground 
connections. 
 
If your antenna is connected directly to the 
rig with no coax (i.e., internal ATU), the only 
way to cure RF problems with the keyer and 
other circuits may be to reduce transmit 
power, seek a better antenna match, or 
improve your ground system  
Operation and Alignment (200-249)

Troubleshooting Steps 
201  EEPROM

 
INFO 201 is an informational message 
only, not a problem indication. You will see 
INFO 201 one time on power-up. The 
only other time you might see this message is 
if you install a new version of the firmware 
that requires a reformat of EEPROM. (In 
most cases new firmware should not cause an 
EEPROM reformat, however.) 
230  BFO not

 
INFO 230 is displayed if you try to use 
CAL FIL without the frequency counter 
connected to the BFO test point (RF-TP2) 
231  VCO not 
connected to frequency 
counter 
 
INFO 231 is displayed if you try to use 
CAL PLL without the frequency counter 
connected to the VCO test point (RF-TP1) 
232  CAL PLL on 
wrong band 
 
INFO 232 is most likely to be displayed 
if you use CAL PLL without first 
selecting 40 meters. 
235  PLL ref. oscillator 
range error 
 
INFO 235 is displayed if CAL PLL 
cannot complete VFO linearization due to 
inadequate PLL reference oscillator range 
(RF-Q19).  
 
You may have the frequency counter probe 
on the wrong test point (should be on TP1) 
 
Re-test the PLL reference oscillator using the 
procedure described under “PLL Reference 
Oscillator Test” in Part II of the RF board 
Alignment and Test section.  
 
If the PLL reference oscillator range is found 
to be inadequate, X1 may be defective. Also 
check D16, D17, C84, C85, and L31 for 
proper value.

Signal Tracing 
 
Signal tracing is the primary method by which radio equipment is tested and 
repaired. You can solve nearly all receiver and transmitter problems yourself 
by following the steps in this section carefully.  
 
RF Probe Assembly 
 
Your K2 kit includes a complete RF probe, including the PC board, coax,  
and connectors. The switch spacing tool, which you used in assembling the 
Front Panel, doubles as the PC board for the probe. The RF probe (Figure 
1) converts RF signals to DC so they can be measured using a DMM. The DC 
readings on your DMM will be approximately equal to the signal voltage in 
Vrms (root-mean-square).

Assembly Instructions: Use a discarded lead from a large diode such as an 
SB530 or 95SQ015 as the probe tip (E1). It should be about 1" (2.5 cm) long. 
All other components for the probe can be found in the MISCELLANEOUS 
bag. An insulated alligator clip is provided for ground (E2). It should be 
connected to the board using 4" of black insulated hookup wire. Two banana 
plugs are supplied for connecting the probe to your DMM (P1-P2). Use 
RG174 coax between the probe board and the banana plugs. The coax should 
be secured to the board using one cable tie. Thread the cable tie through the 
two holes provided, near the coax end of the board. 
 
To use the Probe: Connect E2 to the nearest ground test point, and plug the 
banana jacks into your DMM. Set the DMM for DC volts (20 or 30 V scale). 
Avoid touching the tip or discrete components while taking measurements.
Signal Generator 
 
A simple crystal oscillator (Figure 2) can be used in lieu of a signal generator. 
This oscillator takes its output from the crystal itself, resulting in fairly low 
harmonic content. This results in very slight “pulling” of the oscillator 
frequency as you adjust the output level, but this is of no concern for signal 
tracing. The oscillator will run on voltages as low as 8 V, but 12 V or more is 
recommended to guarantee enough output for all signal tracing steps. The 
components are not critical, and can vary 20% with little variation in 
performance. Nearly any NPN RF transistor will work in the circuit.

Figure 2 
Any crystal frequency that falls in or near a ham band can be used, but 10 
MHz is recommended since our signal tracing measurements were done using 
this band. If you have only completed the K2 up through part II of the RF 
board (40 m), you'll have to use a crystal in the 6.8 to 7.5 MHz range. 
 
You may wish to build the oscillator into an enclosure fitted with a BNC 
connector and level control. Use short leads for all wiring. Use very short 
leads (2”) or coax to connect the signal generator to the K2’s antenna jack.

Receiver and Synthesizer 
In the following steps you’ll use the RF probe and other techniques to find the 
stage where the received signal is getting attenuated. (Figure 3 shows the 
approximate location of the synthesizer, receiver, and other circuits on the RF 
board.) You can then use voltage tables, resistance checks and close 
examination to find the bad component or connection.  
 
Perform all measurements in the order listed. In general, your measurements 
can vary 20-25% from those shown and still be acceptable. Space is provided 
to record your own measurements (in pencil), which will be very useful if you 
need to re-test a particular circuit after repairs. 
 
Preparation for Receiver Signal Tracing 
 
1. Verify that basic display and control circuits are functioning. 
2. Using your DMM, check the 5-V and 8-V regulator outputs. 
3. Measure the voltages on the anodes (right end) of D6 and D7 (on the RF 
board, near the I/O controller, U1). In receive mode, D6’s anode should 
be at about 8 V, and D7’s should be near 0 V. 
4. Connect the RF probe’s output to your DMM’s +/- DC input jacks. 
5. Select a 2 or 3-V DC range.  
6. The DMM should read close to 0.000 V DC. The reading should increase 
when you touch the RF probe tip with your finger. 
7. Turn on the K2 and switch to 30 m (or the appropriate band for your 
signal generator). Select CW Normal mode. 
8. Using the menu, select OPT PERF. 
9. Use CAL FIL to set up CW normal filter FL1 for a bandwidth of  
1.50. If you can hear some noise on your receiver, set up the BFO for 
this filter as described in the Operation section of the manual. Otherwise, 
set the BFO to the factory default value. 
10. Exit CAL FIL, then select the 1.50-bandwidth filter using XFIL.

pin 1 of U4 (MC145170), which is near the front-left corner of the RF 
board (near the control board).  Expected: 0.8-1.8 Vrms. Actual: ______.  
3. VCO Output: Measure the VCO signal at pin 3 of U3 (LT1252). 
Expected: 0.30-0.40 Vrms. Actual: ______. If this signal is zero, you 
may have the secondary winding of T5 reversed. 
4. VCO Buffer Output: Measure the signal on pin 6 of U3. Expected: 
0.60-0.75Vrms. Actual: ______.  
5. Check the VCO frequency (RF Board, Alignment and Test Part II).

BFO (RF, sheet 2) 
 
1. BFO Output: Measure the signal on U11, pin 6 (NE602). Expected: 
0.20-0.70 Vrms. Actual: ______. 
2. Use the menu to select CAL FCTR. Press EDIT again to confirm; the 
display will now show a frequency reading (it will depend on where you 
have the frequency counter probe connected).  
3. BFO Buffer Output: Measure the amplitude of the signal at TP2 using 
the RF probe. Expected: 0.025-0.070 Vrms. Actual: _______. 
4. Exit CAL FCTR. Check the BFO frequency (RF Board, Alignment 
and Test Part II). 
 
Low-Pass Filter, Bandpass Filter, and T-R Switch (RF, sheet 3) 
 
1. Turn both the attenuator and preamp OFF using PRE/ATT.  
2. Set RF GAIN to minimum. 
3. Set AF GAIN to about 10% and connect a pair of headphones. 
4. Switch to the 30 m (or the correct band for your signal generator). 
5. Connect a signal generator or test oscillator to the antenna jack. Set the 
signal generator for 0.14 Vrms as indicated by the RF probe. 
6. If possible, tune the VFO until you hear the signal. It may be quite strong 
even if your receiver is attenuating the signal somewhere. Find the 
approximate signal peak by ear. Set AF GAIN to minimum. 
7. Align the band-pass filter for the current band if possible: (a) Put the RF 
probe on the banded end (cathode) of D6 (to the left of the I/O controller, 
U1); (b) adjust the band-pass filter for the current band for a peak 
indication on the DMM (on 30 m: adjust L8 and L9). 
8. Aligning the band-pass filter may have changed the input impedance of 
the receiver. Put the RF probe back on the antenna input and adjust the 
signal generator for 0.14 Vrms again. 
9. Low-Pass Filter Output: Measure the signal at jumper W1, near the PA 
transistors (Q7/Q8). Expected: 0.13 Vrms. Actual: _______. 
10. T-R Switch #1 Output: Measure the signal at W6, which is just to the 
right of the transverter/60 meter option connector, J13 (near the back 
edge of the board). Expected: .093 Vrms. Actual: _______. 
11. Band-Pass Filter Output: Measure the signal at the left side of D6. 
Expected: .086 Vrms. Actual: ______.  
12. T-R Switch #2 Output: Measure the signal at the right side of D6. 
Expected: .077 Vrms. Actual: ______.  
 
Mixer, I.F. Amplifiers, and Crystal Filter (sheet 2)

Q21. Expected: .077 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
2. Preamp Off Test: Measure the signal at the end of R73 closest to Z6.

filter. Expected: 1.40 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
6. Crystal Filter Output: Touch the RF probe to jumper W3, near the 
crystal filter. Adjust the VFO for a peak in the DMM reading. Expected: 
0.35 Vrms. Actual: _____. If this reading is low, it may be due to a non-
optimal setting of the BFO in CAL FIL. Try a different BFO setting, then 
adjust the VFO for peak again and re-measure the filter loss. (Note: this 
measurement exaggerates the filter loss because the input to the filter is a 
composite of many signals besides the desired one.) 
7. T7 Step-Up Ratio: Measure the signal at U12, pin 4 (MC1350). 
Expected: 0.4-0.8 Vrms. Actual: _____.  Note: Limited by D40-D41. 
8. I.F. Amp Saturated Output: Measure the signal at U12, pin 8. It may 
be anywhere between 0.00 and 0.30 Vrms. Adjust the signal generator 
level until the DMM reads approx. 0.15 Vrms. (If your signal generator 
is running from a 9-V battery you may have trouble getting the output 
this high. Try running the generator from 12V or more in this case.) 
9. 2nd Crystal Filter Output: Measure the signal at U11, pin 1 (NE602). 
Expected: approx. 0.27 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
10. Product Detector Saturated Output: Measure the signal at U11, pin 5 
(NE602). Expected: 0.58 Vrms. Actual: _____.

chassis ground.  
2. Turn the signal generator completely OFF (remove its power). 
3. Set RF GAIN to maximum. 
4. No-Signal AGC, Max. IF Gain: Measure the DC voltage on pin 1 of U2 
(LM833). Expected: 3.6 V. Actual: _____. 
5. Set RF GAIN to minimum.

6. No-Signal AGC, Min. IF Gain: Measure the DC voltage on pin 1 of U2. 
Expected: 4.6 V. Actual: _____. 
7. Turn the signal generator back on. 
8. AGC @ Saturation: Measure the DC voltage on pin 1 of U2. Expected: 
6.9 V. Actual: _____. Adjust the VFO to make sure this voltage is at its 
peak.  
9. I.F. Amp AGC Input: Measure the DC voltage on pin 5 of U12 (RF, 
sheet 2). Expected: 5.0 V. Actual: _____. 
 
Product Detector  and AF Amp (RF, Sheet 2) 
 
1. Set up the DMM to read AC volts (use a 2 or 3-V meter range). 
2. Touch the (+) lead of the DMM to pin 5 of U11 (NE602). Decrease the 
signal generator level until the AC voltage at pin 5 reads .025 Vrms. (The 
K2’s RF GAIN control should still be at minimum.) 
3. Disconnect the headphones and speaker. Turn the AF GAIN control to 
maximum. 
4. Measure the signal at the speaker jack, P5 pin 1 (near the on/off switch, 
S1). Expected: 1.6 Vrms. Actual: _____.  
 
I.F. Amp Noise Gain (RF, sheet 2) 
 
1. Turn the signal generator off and disconnect it from the antenna jack. 
Connect a 50-ohm dummy load. 
2. Turn off all nearby equipment (especially computers or signal sources). 
3. Set AF GAIN to maximum. Set RF GAIN to minimum. 
4. Make sure the preamp and attenuator are both OFF. 
5. Verify that FL1 is selected (bandwidth = 1.50), as well as CW Normal 
mode. 
6. AF Output, Min. IF gain: Setup the DMM for its lowest AC volts 
range. Measure the signal at the speaker jack, P5 (near the on/off switch, 
S1). Expected: 0.000-0.001 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
7. AF Output, Max. IF gain: Set RF GAIN to maximum. Measure the 
signal at P5, pin 1. Expected: 0.007-0.013 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
8. Preamp Noise Gain: Turn on the preamp. Measure the signal at P5. 
Expected: 0.030-0.060 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
9. Noise Increase w/Antenna: Connect an antenna. The signal at P5 should 
increase substantially even if atmospheric conditions are quiet. A typical 
reading on 30 or 40 m is 0.20-0.40 Vrms. In general, the longer or higher 
your antenna is, the greater the noise increase will be.  
Final Steps 
 
If you have completed receiver signal tracing and any necessary repairs, you 
should then do the following: 
 
1. Re-install the bottom cover and heat sink.  
2. Re-do calibration of the VCO, BFO, band-pass filters, crystal filters, etc. 
as needed (see RF Board Alignment and Test, parts I, II, and III). If you 
peaked L8 and L9 when signal tracing through the 30-m band-pass filter, 
you’ll need to re-peak C21 and C23 on 20 m. 
3. Leave the frequency counter cable connected to TP2 (BFO) 
4. Connect the speaker and re-install the top cover. 
Transmitter 
The following procedure can be used to isolate problems with the transmitter 
(the transmitter area of the RF board is identified in Figure 3). CW mode is 
used for these tests. If you’re having difficulty with the SSB adapter, make 
sure the transmitter works on CW first, then proceed with the signal tracing 
instructions in the SSB adapter manual.  
 
Once you find a location where the signal appears to be much lower than 
expected, stop signal tracing and check that circuit. Check all component 
values and DC voltages (see DC Voltage Tables). Closely examine the PC 
board for unsoldered pins and solder bridges. One of most likely causes of a 
transmitter problem is a poorly-soldered toroid lead. Re-heat any suspect 
leads or solder joints. 
 
Preparation for Transmitter Signal Tracing 
 
1. Make sure basic display and control circuits are functioning before 
attempting transmitter testing. 
2. Remove the SSB adapter (if installed) and install temporary jumpers at 
J9 and J10. Temporarily re-install C167 (.001 µF or higher) between pins 
7 and 12 of J11. (See RF board, sheet 2.) 
3. 12 V supply check: Use your DMM to check the DC voltage at the 
cathode (banded end) of D10 (right edge of the board). Expected: 9 to 14 
V. Actual: _____. Verify that the same voltage (or slightly lower) can be 
found on the case (collector) of Q5 and the tab (collector) of Q6 when the 
K2 is turned on and is in receive mode.

4. If you don’t have an RF probe, you can build the one from Figure 1. 
Note: do not use the RF probe to directly measure the transmitter’s 
power output unless you have the power set for 2 W or less. The 1N34A 
diode in the RF probe may be damaged at higher power levels. 
5. Test Shared Circuits: Do the receiver signal tracing (above). This tests 
a number of circuits that are shared by both transmitter and receiver, 
including the VCO, BFO, BFO buffer, T-R switches, band-pass filters, 
and low-pass filters. It’s important not to skip this step, even if the 
receiver seems to be working correctly. Shared circuits that are working 
marginally may affect the transmitter more than the receiver, so their 
actual output levels must be measured. 
6. Set up the K2 for 40 meters (about 7100 kHz), CW Normal mode.  
7. Plug in a 50-ohm dummy load (10-W or higher rating). 
8. Set the power level to 5 watts. 
9. Connect a hand key or keyer paddle to the key jack. 
10. Connect a speaker or headphones. 
11. Use the menu to set ST L 030, ST P 0.50, and T-R 0.05.  
12. Select hand key mode (INP HAND). 
13. Set up a transmit current limit of 2.50 amps using CAL CUR. 
 
Basic voltage checks (RF schematic, sheet 2) 
 
Note: When using TUNE to key the transmitter, be sure to tap TUNE again 
within 5 seconds or less each time. This will reduce the chance of damaging 
any components in the transmitter that are consuming excess power. 
 
1. Switch to voltage/current display mode using DISPLAY.   
2. Hold TUNE to key the transmitter, and verify that supply voltage does 
not drop by more than about 0.8 V. If it drops more than this, either your 
power supply is inadequate or the transmitter is drawing excess current. 
Actual transmit-mode voltage: _____  V. Current: _____ A. 
3. Return to normal display mode using DISPLAY. 
4. Measure the key-down DC voltages on the anodes (right end) of D6 and 
D7 (near U1, the I/O controller). During transmit, the voltage on the 
anode of  D7 should be about 8 V, and on D6, near 0 V. Actual TX-mode 
voltages, D6: _____ V; D7: _____ V. 
5. Use TUNE and note the actual power output: _____ W. 
 
Sidetone (Control Board) 
 
Note: If the sidetone is already functioning correctly, you can skip this 
section. 
 
1. Make sure you’re in CW mode. The sidetone will not function in SSB 
modes.  
2. Disconnect the headphones and speaker. 
3. Use the menu to set ST L to 255 (maximum sidetone level). 
4. Use the VOX button to select CW TEST mode (the mode letter will then 
flash). This is a safe setting for sidetone tests, since there is no power 
output.  
5. Set your DMM for AC volts, 2 or 3-V range. Touch the positive lead of 
the DMM to pin 4 of U8 on the control board (18C452). (This is the 
source of the sidetone signal.) 
6. Key the transmitter using the hand key (TUNE does not activate the 
sidetone). Measure the AC voltage on pin 4 of U8. Expected: 2.5 Vrms. 
Actual: _____. Un-key the transmitter. 
7. Move the DMM probe to the drain of Q5 (control board, 2N7000). Key 
the transmitter and measure the AC drain voltage. Expected: 2.4 Vrms. 
Actual: _____. If this is zero, either Q5 is defective or there is no drain 
voltage supply from pin 1 of U8 (MAX534, D-to-A converter).  
8. Measure the AC voltage on pin 7 of U10 (LMC660). Expected: 0.5 
Vrms. Actual: _____. 
9. Measure the AC voltage on pin 8 of U9 (LM380). Expected: 0.5 Vrms. 
Actual: _____. 
10. Measure the AC voltage on pin 6 of U9. Expected: 0.5 Vrms. Actual: 
_____. This signal should also be present on the speaker jack, P5 pin 1 
(RF board). 
11. Return the ST L setting to 030. 
12. Use the VOX button to put the transmitter back into OPERate mode. 
 
ALC (control board) 
 
1. Make sure the POWER control is set for 5 watts, and that you’re in 
CW/Operate mode. 
2. Set up the DMM for DC volts, 20 or 30-V range. 
3. Power Control Test (VPWR line): The VPWR line, pin 2 of U8 
(MAX534), is where transmit power control begins. On key-down, the 
microprocessor (U6) starts increasing the voltage on VPWR until it sees 
the desired power indication from the RF output detector (RF board, 

============================================================
PAGE 166
============================================================

 
 
 
                                                                          14 
sheet 3, lower right-hand corner). To test VPWR, set the DMM for DC 
volts, then measure the DC voltage on pin 2 of U8 when TUNE is 
pressed. Expected: 0.7-2.5 VDC. Actual: _____.  
4. If VPWR reading is high (> 4.5 V): The ALC software will set VPWR 
to its highest level (about 5 V) if the transmitter cannot be driven to the 
requested power level. This happens for one of two reasons: (a) the 
transmitter gain is low (or transmitter isn’t working at all); (b) the RF 
detector has an incorrect component. Check all component values in the 
RF detector. If you can’t find a problem with the RF detector, continue 
with the next signal tracing section (transmit mixer, etc.). 
5. If VPWR reading is low (< 0.4V): VPWR can be too low because: (a) 
the ALC software is being “fooled” by a signal from the RF detector that 
says the power is higher than it really is; (b) because U8 on the control 
board is defective or has a pin shorted to ground or not soldered. Check 
all component values in the RF detector (RF, sheet 3). If these appear 
correct, check DC voltages on U8 (control), as well as resistance to 
ground on all pins. 
 
Transmit Mixer, Buffer, Band-Pass Filter, T-R Switch (RF, sheets 2-3) 
 
Note: The measurements in this section and the next may vary widely, 
especially if you do the measurements on a band other than 40 m. However, 
the ratio between any two back-to-back measurements should remain fairly 
constant, and is a good indication of gain or loss of a stage in the transmitter. 
For example, the ratio of measurements in steps 3 and 2 below is about 12. 
 
1. Connect the RF probe to the DMM. Set the DMM for a 2 or 3-V DC 
volts range. 
2. Xmit Mixer Output: Measure the key-down signal  at U10, pin 4. 
Expected: 0.016 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
3. Buffer Output: Measure the key-down signal  at U9, pin 6 (LT1252). 
Expected: 0.200 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
4. Band-Pass Filter Output: Measure the key-down signal at W6. 
Expected: 0.030 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
5. T-R Switch #1 Output: Measure the key-down signal at the anode of 
D1. Expected: 0.029 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
 
Pre-driver, Driver, and PA (RF, sheet 4) 
 
1. Pre-Driver Output: Measure the key-down signal at the case (collector) 
of Q5 (2N5109). Expected: 0.120 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
2. Driver Input: Measure the key-down signal on the base of Q6 (2SC5739 
or 2SC2166; pins are labeled B, C, E). Expected: 0.026 Vrms. Actual: 
_____. 
3. Driver Output: Measure the key-down signal at the tab (collector) of 
Q6. Expected: 1.8 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
4. PA Input (Q7): Measure the key-down signal at the base of Q7 
(2SC1969 on bottom of the board; pins are labeled on the top). Expected: 
0.38 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
5. PA Input (Q8): Measure the key-down signal at the base of Q8. 
Expected: 0.38 Vrms. Actual: _____. 
6. RF Detector Input: Measure the key-down signal on the anode (non-
banded end) of D9 (1N5711, middle of the right edge of the board). 
Expected: 2.0 Vrms. Actual: _____. (This voltage should be fairly 
constant regardless of the band used.) 
7. PA Transistor Tests: If the PA input voltages were higher than 
expected, but the RF detector input was too low, one or both PA 
transistors could be defective. After checking DC voltages and 
transformer leads, turn off power to the K2 and use your DMM’s 
diode/transistor test range to test the transistors. With the DMM’s 
positive lead on the base of Q7, you should measure about 0.6 k to the 
emitter or collector. With the DMM’s negative lead on the base of Q7, 
you should measure about 1.3 k to the emitter and > 3 k to the collector. 
These also apply to Q8. 
 
DC Voltage Tables 
 
The tables on the following pages provide DC voltages for all ICs and 
transistors on each of the three boards, as well as the diodes in the T-R switch 
(RF board). Typically, your readings will match these within 10%.The 
voltages were measured using a high-impedance DMM (10-11 Megohm). 
The K2’s internal voltmeter can also be used for most measurements.  
 
Receive-mode voltages are listed except as noted. Most of the Control board 
measurements were made with the Front Panel module removed for easier 
access. Exceptions are indicated by (**). 
 
Equipment Setup: Supply voltage 14.0 V; no antenna; LCD = NITE; GRPH 
= DOT; receive mode; no headphones or speaker connected; RF GAIN mid-
range; AF GAIN minimum; OFFSET mid-range.
