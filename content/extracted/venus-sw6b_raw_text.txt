Connections
External power supply and internal battery connectors:
Any stable, clean 10-14VDC source may be used via the 5.5mm x 2.1 mm power connector.

There is space for an internal battery, a three-cell 18650 lithium battery pack (voltage 11-12.6V).
If the internal battery is installed, you may stil usean external power supply. The voltage of the
external power supply must be A/gher than the voltage of the built-in battery.

If the external supply voltage is lower than the voltage of the built-in battery, the radio will
use the built-in battery power supply, even though external power is supplied. .


============================================================
PAGE 4
============================================================

CHARGE:

The CHARGE connector is for charging the internal battery. , please use the lithium battery charger
for the built-in battery charging (if you don't have a built-in battery installed in the interface can be
used as an external power supply interface). The CHARGE connector is for charging the built-in
battery.)

Antenna:

Any resonant / well-matched (50 Ohm) antenna may be connected to the ANT jack BNC connector.

An external antenna tuner is required for antennas that are not resonant at the selected frequency.
The radio does not provide for any adjustments other than audio /RF gain and VFO.

High SWR will likely damage the radio over time. Use care when tuning any antenna. It is
strongly suggested to use a series of 'dits' to reduce the chance of damage to the final amplifier

while tuning. See the manual for your antenna tuner for instructions on how to match an antenna
to the SW-6B radio set.

Headphones
A stereo headset may be connected to the PHONE jack. Impedance should be 8-32 Ohms. A

stereo connector must be used. A MONO headphone plug will SHORT the output!
A 90° connector on the headphone’s, to reduce strain to the jack, is recommend .
Setting the switch to SPK will activate the internal speaker.

Key/Paddle

If using a stereo plug for a straight key, both ring and sleeve must be connected together for
use. A monaural plug may also be used with a straight key. The radio is set to detect the type of
key used. With paddles and a stereo plug, the internal keyer is automatically enabled on power up
and annunciated with the Morse letter "A".

TIP. Connects to DOT paddle or
one side of straight key contact

RING. Connects to DASH paddle or straight key ground

SLEEVE. Connects to paddle or straight key ground

3.5mm stereo plug

Keyer Operation

When power is applied with a paddle connected or no key is present, the letter “A” will be heard in
the headphones upon power up.

The letter “M” is heard if a straight key is connected on power up. Connect the key prior to power
up to ensure the radio senses the type of key in use.

AF GAIN

Used to set volume of received signal. Turn control clockwise to increase volume. Exercise caution
if using "earbuds".

RF GAIN

Provides variable attenuation of incoming (RF) signal to the first mixer. This is useful in noisy band
conditions.

The permitted transmitting frequencies are: 3.5-3.8MHz, 5.35-5.368MHz, 7.0-7.2MHz, 14-
14.35MHz, 18.068-18.168MHz, and 21.0-21.45MHz.

When transmitting withinthe listed frequency ranges, the display will show the word TX, and the S-
meter under the LCD is changed to show the transmitting power withaP.

There are 3 pipsAonthe(P) bar graph on the transmit power scale in addition to the 0 scale, the first
pip is roughly 1 Watt of RF power, the second pip is roughly 3 Watts of RF, and the final pip to the far
right of the bar graph, is roughly 5 Watts of RF.

NOTE - The radio detects the RF voltage output to the antenna port, the power displayed is accurate
onlywhen the standing wave is close to 1:1 (ie matched or resonant antenna).

The OP red indicator light at the top right of the panel flashes when the radio set transmits.
Out of Band Operation:

When attempting to transmit outside of these frequency ranges, the display will show the
word ERR The radio will not transmit, but, the sidetone can still be heard. You can take
advantage of this feature to use as a code practice device or to load the message memories.

OP/TUNE Tuning Switch for SWR indicator:
This switch is used to employ the Tayloe type SWR indicator.

When the switch in in the TUNE position, a 50 ohm bridge is placed in line with the antenna
connector.

Following your antenna tuner instructions, tune for maximum noise in receive.. When transmitting
(a series of ,,dits” is recommended) the LED above the switch will glow if there is not a correct
match. Making fine adjustments of the tuner will cause the LED to fully extinguish or grow very
dim.

When the LED is fully extinguished, or very dim, you have a good match between the SW-6B radio
set and the antenna.

If a fully resonant antenna is employed, the LED will remain dim or dark.

When you have completed the tuning process, place the switch back into the OP position.

(see the web for more information about this unique circuit)

NOTE — If you wish to operate at lower power levels, you may leave the switch in the TUNE
position or reduce the input voltage.

Keyer settings:
Speed adjustment knob - SPEED

The SPEED knob near the bottom left of the panel controls the keyer speed. It increases in by
turning clockwise and slower by turning counterclockwise.

M1, M2 buttons

M1 and M2 are two auto-call buttons, two auto-call messages can be pre-stored respectively.
Briefly press the M1 or M2 button, then relase immediately to automatically start the stored
content.

The memory characters are manually input by the user, as described below.

To cancel the auto-call during the auto-call process, briefly press the M1 or M2 button and then
release it.

Entering memory characters:
This operation is not available when using the straight keys, you must use paddels..

Press and Hold the M1 or M2 button for about 2 seconds.

After hearing the Morse code letter I, release the M1 or M2 button.

Enter you r message string (~20 characters)

Quickly press the CQ button hear the Morse code letter E to Exit.

M1 and M2 can be pre-stored independently.

In the state of call sign input, the display will show the word TX but the SW-6B radio set wi// not
transmit, this is normal.

Storage capacity for automatic messages:

The automatic call storage capacity in the radio can probably store about 20 characters, because
the length of each character's code is different, so the number of characters that the memory
can store is also different, if the number of characters entered exceeds the content that the
memory can hold the radio will not be able to store it, at this time the radio will be emptied of
the contents of the memory.

Sidetone volume level adjustment:

To the left of the SPEED knob, there is a ST adjustment hole. this is to adjust the volume of
the side volume when transmitting. Use a small, flat blade screwdriver for adjustment. Turn it
clockwise to increase the volume, turn it counterclockwise to decrease the volume.

Frequency Calibration
1. DDS frequency calibration

If the transmit frequency of the machine is off, it can be calibrated as follows:

Turn off the power, press and hold the M/V/S button and RIT/M button at the same time and then
turn on the power, keep holding the two buttons for about 3 seconds and then release the two
buttons when the display shows the following:

QUTPUT

10.000. 00MHz

At this time, use a calibrated frequency meter to detect the frequency of the TEST point on
the PCB board (near pin 1 of IC7), rotate the large knob to adjust the frequency to the frequency
meter display 10.000.00MHz, and after that, lightly press the M/V/S button to exit and enter the IF
frequency calibration.

2. IF frequency calibration

The display shows the following after exiting from DDS frequency calibration:

IF = 491258

7.023.00)

$

At this time, access the signal source at the antenna end of the machine, adjust the
frequency to 7.023MHz, rotate the large knob to adjust the IF frequency to the maximum
strength of the received signal.

Tap the M/V/S button to exit the frequency calibration state.
