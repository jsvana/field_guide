The NorCal 20 Construction Manual
Introduction
The NorCal 20 is a high performance QRP CW transceiver
kit for the 20m band. It has been designed to operate well
in the presence of large out-of-band (short-wave broadcast)
and in-band (contest station just down the road) unwanted
signals. It should easily meet the requirements most
QRP’ers, from the most competitive contester to the casual
operator.
The kit contains all the parts needed to build a complete
working radio. The only things the user will have to supply
are the power source and supply cable, a loudspeaker or
headphones, a set of paddles or straight key (suitably
wired) and a matched 20m antenna system.
The kit is designed with no wiring required - all the
components are mounted on a single double-sided with
plated through holes, solder masked and silk screened
printed circuit board that measures 4.5” by 5”. Pre-drilled
front and rear panels with U shaped top and bottom panels
are provided that form a clamshell type case that is smart,
strong and functional. The case is bare aluminum. Painting
and labeling (not necessary, but nice) is left to the
constructor.
General Description
The NorCal 20 is a single band QRP CW transceiver
optimized for good RF performance rather than for low
current drain. As such, it is suited mainly for operation from
home-based stations or portable operations with fairly large
battery capability (e.g. field day). On receive the current
drain can be as much as 150mA. It can produce any output
power from 0 to about 7 Watts. The output power is set
with a small trimpot inside the rig.
The NorCal 20 uses fully electronic RX/TX switching (no
relays) that gives very smooth, thump-free, semi-break-in
operation. The transmit output waveform is edge controlled
to minimize bandwidth usage. As a bonus, this makes for
very nice sounding Morse code on the air.
The NorCal 20 offers many advanced features that make it
easy to use.
The NorCal 20 has a single conversion superheterodyne
receiver and an equivalent single stage up-conversion
transmitter. The I.F. is 9MHz with the VFO at 5MHz.
The NorCal 20 has been designed to utilize either a 1 turn
(supplied) or a 10 turn (you supply) TUNE pot. It also has
an RIT pot with center detent.
No frequency calibration or scale is needed because the rig
has a built in frequency counter, known as the Audible
Frequency Annunciator (AFA). This plays the KHz digits of
the 
frequency 
to 
you 
in 
Morse 
code 
over 
the
speaker/headphones. The AFA has two modes of
operation. 
Manual 
mode, 
where 
the 
frequency 
is
announced only when you press the front panel push-
button, and automatic mode, where the AFA “pips” at every
KHz as you tune up or down the band, then, recognizes
when you stop tuning, and announces the frequency
automatically.
The NorCal 20 has a built in Morse code keyer chip from
the Embedded Research TiCK line. This keyer allows you
to swap the paddles over, set the speed, tune-up, run
straight key mode and run in either iambic A or B modes.
The NorCal 20 is VFO tuned. Much attention has been paid
to making the VFO as stable as possible. Some warm-up
drift is to be expected, as, from cold, the rig will warm-up
significantly due to the large amount of current sacrificed in
making the receiver front-end performance satisfactory.
Typical warm-up drift is in the region of a few hundred Hz.
The receiver has AGC – two AGC loops in fact – that is
audio derived (IF derived was too expensive to add, but
could be done as a modification). In addition to the AGC,
the user still has ultimate front-end signal level control - the
rig includes an RF Attenuator pot (rear panel mounted).
The receiver consists of a double tuned Cohn bandpass
filter feeding a moderate gain tuned FET pre-amplifier
(about 6 to 8dB gain, just enough to overcome mixer loss).
This feeds a +7dBm level Minicircuits TFM-2 diode-ring
double balanced mixer. This device is almost identical to
the more commonly used TUF-1, but was significantly
cheaper. The mixer output is fed into a broadband 50?
terminated amplifier that runs enough current to ensure the
2nd and 3rd order intercept points (IP2/3) of the radio are not
compromised. The output of this amplifier is terminated
with a 50?  -6dB pad then fed to the four crystal main
receive filter. The crystals used for the NorCal 20 were
specially selected and matched to within 50Hz (or better),
ensuring a flat topped narrow-band response that is a joy to
listen to.
The main filter is followed by a low noise IF amplifier with a
matched roofing crystal filter feeding the product detector.

The roofing filter removes a lot of opposite sideband noise
that would otherwise be present as audio noise in the
product detector’s output. Careful attention has been paid
to the IF layout resulting in an overall stopband attenuation
that is remarkably good.
The product detector (NE602) feeds balanced audio to a
simple low-pass op-amp filter/amplifier with a cutoff
frequency around 1.2KHz and a passband gain of about
11dB. The output of this is fed via the TX/RX mute FET to
another bandpass filter/amplifier stage that has a center
frequency of 700Hz, a Q of 5 and a gain of about 30dB.
The output of this is fed to the 2W LM380N audio amplifier
via the front panel mounted volume control.
The transmitter mixes the VFO and a carrier oscillator up to
14MHz, filters it and amplifies it to a user adjustable level
up to about 7W. The class A driver stage uses a parallel
pair of 2N2222 transistors that drive the 2SC1969 output
power transistor in class C. This transistor uses the rear
panel of the rig as its heatsink.
The transmitter output filtering uses a novel harmonic
attenuation arrangement that was recently described in the
ARRL QEX journal. This significantly reduces transmitted
harmonics. A spectrum analyzer plot shows them all
(including 2nd and 3rd  harmonics) to be below    –70dB
from the main carrier.
TX/RX changeover is all electronic. When a paddle key is
pressed, the TiCK output drives a switching circuit that
provides a linearly ramped transmit power supply rail to the
low power transmit stages. This ensures a clean, almost
ideally shaped transmit output RF envelope. Likewise, at
the end of a Morse code element, the TiCK output drives
the switching circuitry to ensure a linearly ramped trailing
edge to the transmit power. This ensures a clean tail end
for the output RF envelope.
The RX mute signal is also derived from the transmit
timing/switching circuitry. The mute signal ensures the
AGC is disabled and the receiver is muted prior to the
transmit output envelope rise, and that the transmit output
envelope is complete, and the receiver stable, prior to
enabling the AGC and opening the receiver mute once
more. This all happens in the space of a few milliseconds,
which gives the rig semi-break-in capabilities

This is with the standard 1 turn, 270? pot as supplied. Ergonomics dictate the maximum frequency range
with this type of pot. Modification pads are provided on the PCB for a 10 turn pot. With this user
modification in place, the frequency range can be increased to 70KHz or more. See the
Modifications/Experimentation appendix on page 20.
2 
Since the LM380N produces noise at all audio frequencies, it is recommended that the user place a
suitable low pass filter in circuit when using headphones – this will help to reduce annoying hiss. A
suitable filter is described in the Modifications/Experimentation appendix on page 21. This can be fitted
inside the radio with a separate headphone jack if required.

Before You Do Anything Else - Read This!
Construction of the NorCal 20 is best done in sections, one
at a time. The manual therefore uses the “build-a-section,
test-a-section” method. Building it this way saves lots of
trouble in the long run. The NorCal 20 is a fairly complex
radio: all the parts are closely spaced and there is great
potential for error both in picking the correct part and
placing it in the board. You must positively identify the
parts correctly prior to soldering them into the PCB. Special
care should be exercised over identifying the capacitors for
the transmit amplifier, these are 100V components and
should not be mixed up with the lower voltage parts used
elsewhere. 
There 
are 
part 
identification 
tips 
and
insertion/mounting details throughout the manual.
Also, please pay careful attention to the winding of the
toroids. They can only be wound one way properly.
Pictures are provided to help you to do this correctly.
Like the resistors (apart from R80), all the axial leaded
diodes in the NorCal 20 are mounted vertically. They are all
mounted the same way to avoid confusion. They should all
be mounted with the BAR end of the diode (the cathode)
UP:
The PCB silkscreen shows a circle with a wire going to the
adjacent hole. Next to the wire end, there is a small + sign.
This appears to be a European notation. It works, so I
decided to keep it. The + end is where the bar end of the
diode should go – just as in the drawing above. Be careful
when bending any of the glass encapsulated diodes – try to
bend them a little away from where the wire enters the
body – they are not easily broken, but I have known them
to get damaged like this on occasion.
Note also that all 37 of the 0.1?F and all 13 of the 0.01?F
decoupling capacitors (items 65 and 64) are fitted vertically
like the resistors and diodes. Follow the layout silk screen
for orientation.
Be careful not to get solder in the wrong hole - the parts
are very close together on the PCB so it is easily done.
Use a very fine tip soldering iron (1/16” bit), 22awg solder
(with flux core) and lots of care. If you do get solder in the
wrong hole, or if you need to remove a component for
some reason, use a de-soldering pump (solder sucker), or
a piece of de-soldering braid and carefully remove the
solder. Do not heat the pad/hole for long, as overheating
will damage the PCB. It is better waste a component by
snipping it out then removing the short stubs of wire left in
the holes rather than ruining the PCB and saving the
component.
All the pots used in the NorCal 20 will require their panel
mounting lugs (…) to be removed prior to fitting to the
PCB/panels. To do this, simply bend the lug with a pair of
pliers. You may need to bend the lug back and forth a
couple of times, but it should easily break off.
Some of the parts in the NorCal 20 kit are sensitive to
damage by static electricity. Make sure your soldering iron
has a grounded bit and that you are working in a
reasonably static-free environment. Prior to handling any of
the semiconductor devices in the kit, it is a good idea to
ground yourself by touching your station’s ground bar (you
do have a station ground, don’t you?!). Better still would be
a 
proper 
anti-static 
mat 
and 
wrist 
ground 
strap
arrangement, but we can’t all go that far!
The NorCal 20 is easiest to build with the PCB assembled
with the front and rear panels. This allows you to fit a
component then turn the rig over to solder it in place. It
also allows you to connect the rig up to a power supply,
speaker/phones, a key and an antenna or dummy load for
easy testing of the rig in stages.
Every pin of every electronic component must be soldered.
Even though it may appear that an IC pin or component
lead is not connected to anything (on the underside of the
board), it may still be connected on the top layer where you
cannot see it, so must be soldered in place to complete the
circuit. All the holes on the PCB are plated through, so they
make connection from the top to the bottom of the board.
Aim to complete each section of the rig build in one sitting.
This will ensure you don’t miss a part or step out. The kit
should take about a week of evenings to complete.
Good luck and have fun building it!

Section 1 - Opening the Parts Bags
The parts have been pre-sorted into several bags and
sealed. The bags are doubly protected: they are inside an
outer bag that is also sealed. This should ensure no parts
go astray in shipping. Check that you have the following
items in your kit before going any further:
1. Manual – if you’re doing this check, you’ve got it!
2. Four pieces of pre-drilled case - taped together to
prevent damage in transit (you may need to remove
some of the tape glue using a solvent cleaner prior to
painting)
3. Large sealed plastic bag containing:
a) Double sided, plated through hole, solder masked,
silk screened printed circuit board
b) Plastic bag containing resistors
c) Plastic bag containing capacitors, including the
trimmer capacitors
d) Plastic bag containing transistors, diodes and a
heatsink
e) Plastic bag containing a paper envelope of 9MHz
crystals, a plastic bag with a tiny crystal, a large
diode and a piece of anti-static foam with IC’s on
it.
f) Plastic bag containing three small reels of wire,
toroids and inductors
g) Plastic 
bag 
containing 
hardware 
including
miniature push-button switches and rubber feet
h) Plastic bag containing pots, knobs, connectors
and miniature trim pots
The first thing you should do is open the bag of transistors
and diodes. In this bag you will find 21 small 1N914 diodes
strung together (“tape and reel” fashion). You will also find
two similar looking diodes loose in the bag. These are the
1N754A 6.8V zener diodes (item 74). In order for these not
to get mixed up with the 1N914 diodes, you should
immediately identify, separate and mark the zener diodes.
For example, wrap a piece of masking tape around the two
diodes and write “1N754A” on it.
Sort the other transistors carefully. All the TO-92 cased
devices look the same. The lettering/numbering on them is
very small – if necessary, use a magnifying glass to identify
the parts. Notice that 4 of the TO-92 devices have only 2
leads. These are diodes. Three of them are PIN diodes for
the AGC and the fourth is the varicap for the VFO.
Using the parts list at the back of this manual, select and
identify the other parts. In particular, pay careful attention to
the capacitors. There are several instances where there
are capacitors of the same value, but where the type of
capacitor and the job it is intended to do are quite different.
An identification guide is provided alongside the parts list.
The capacitors used in the transmitter output stage are
most critical. These must be 100V low dielectric loss types
as there are very high RF voltages at this point in the
circuit. Make sure you get this right - you don’t want to let
any smoke out of them! Also, the 82pF C0G capacitor for
the VFO is critical. This capacitor has the marking “C0G”
on it just below the value “820”.
The tiny 100KHz crystal (X8) should be handled with great
care – it is very small and fragile, so it will easily get lost or
broken.
Check that you have all the parts listed in the parts list. If
you have any missing or obviously broken parts, contact
NorCal for a replacement straight away. Please be warned
- many of the parts used in the NorCal 20 kit will not be
available later as spares. If you are going to leave your kit
untouched and later find a part is missing, you may not be
able to get the part from NorCal. We are going to set a
reasonable time limit of 1 month from the date of shipping
for this. After this time we’ll do whatever we can to help but
you may be out of luck.
If you are having trouble identifying any part or have any
technical questions on the NorCal 20, please let me know
by email and I’ll do what I can to help (AD6A@qsl.net)
When you have built the kit, you will have two resistors (R9
and R52), a diode (1N914) that was removed from the
design, and quite a bit of 26/28awg wire left over.  Don’t
panic, this is normal.
Section 2 - Rear Panel
The rear panel should be assembled prior to the front
panel to allow easier alignment of the panels with the PCB.
?  Fit and solder the two stereo jack sockets J1 and J3 to
the PCB. Make sure their fixing nuts are removed and they
are pushed down flat against the board before soldering
them.
?  Loose fit the BNC, J2, the power connector J4 and the
RF attenuation pot, VR3 to the PCB. Place the flat washer
on the pot VR3 but leave the toothed washer off the BNC
for now.
?  Align the PCB with the rear panel. Place the toothed
washer and ring nut on the BNC and finger tighten it in
place.
?  Place the two nuts on the stereo jack sockets J1 and J3,
finger tight. Place the nut on the shaft of the pot (VR3)
finger tight.

6
?  Making sure the PCB is perpendicular to, and level
across the width of, the rear panel, turn it over and solder
the BNC (J2) and the pot, VR3, in place.
?  Next, look at the alignment of the power connector, J4,
through the hole in the rear panel. Make sure it is centered
in the hole before soldering it in place. Fill the power
connector’s PCB through holes with solder – quite a bit of
current is going to be flowing here.
The output power transistor will be fitted later.
?  Find the solder lug (item 107) and cut the end off it so
that when positioned on the rear panel it does not protrude
into R80’s PCB space. Fit it to the rear panel grounding
hole at the opposite end of the rear panel to the jack
sockets. Use 4-40 1/4” screw (item 108) and nut (item 109)
to hold the solder lug in place. Orient it so that it aligns with
the GND pad on the PCB. Once aligned and tightened in
place, bend and solder the lug directly to the GND pad on
the PCB with a healthy dab of solder. This connection
needs to be as electrically short as it can possibly be.
Section 3 - Front Panel
If you are going to fit a 10 turn pot to your NorCal 20, now
is a good time to buy it/find it and fit it. If you purchased
one of the 10 turn pots from the QRP-L group buy, then
with just a little bit of modification the lugs it should fit nicely
into the board holes.
You may have to twist and/or bend the lugs a little to make
it fit. Alternatively, you can file a tiny bit off the lugs to make
them appear vertical to the PCB and fit it without any
bending. If you did not buy your 10 turn pot from the QRP-
L group buy, then you can either purchase the correct item
from 
Mouser

sales@mouser.com) part number 569-7286-10K, or find a
similar item from elsewhere. The PCB will accept the BI
Technologies 7286 series, the Spectrol 534 series or the
Bourns 3540 series pots without much problem. You will
have to cut/file/bend the lugs a little to make your pot fit.
The group buy pots need a little trimming off the lugs with a
pair of cutters to get them to fit snugly. Whichever pot you
choose to use, do not solder it in place just yet.
You may require a large flat washer on the 10 turn pot
behind the front panel to fill out the gap from the front panel
to the shoulder on the 10 turn pot. I found some standard
0.825” O.D., 15/32” I.D. by 1/16” thick washers that worked
very well indeed. No extra build-up washer should be
necessary using the 1 turn pot. Also, you will probably
have to cut off a small piece of the 10 turn pot’s shaft
(about 3/16”) to get the large tuning knob to fit nicely back
against the front panel. Do this in a vise, prior to soldering
the pot - it’s much easier than trying to cut it when it’s
mounted!
?  Note that SW1 and SW2 are fitted underneath the PCB,
on the track side. Fit and solder them into the PCB at this
time. Make sure they are flat against the PCB or they will
not line up with the front panel holes.
?  Loose fit all the other front panel controls to the PCB, but
do not solder them yet - VR1, VR2 and VR4. VR2 will need
its lugs bending dead straight in-line with the metal
connectors as they come off the pot’s body. You will need
to use a small pair of needlenose pliers to do this. If the
lugs are not straight, the front panel will not fit properly - it
will be the wrong distance from the PCB that could result in
a gap. There should be essentially no gap between the
PCB and either the front or back panels. This would have
the knock-on effect of the case top and bottom not fitting
correctly.
?  If you are using a 10 turn pot, you’ll notice about now
that it doesn’t fit in the front panel hole. You will need to
first drill out the hole to fit your particular pot. Users of the
QRP-L group buy pot - simply drill it out to 3/8”. Then you
will need to use a circular file to elongate the hole towards
the top of the front panel. The 10 turn pot’s center is higher
than the other pots, and this will allow everything to align
properly.
?  Place the flat washers (or toothed washer if you are
fitting a 10 turn pot) onto the shaft of each pot.
?  Place the large solder lug (item 106) onto the shaft of the
RIT pot, VR2, with the lug to the right hand side of the rig
as you look at the front panel. The lug should be on the
same side as the TUNE pot, so that you can easily solder a
wire from it to the GND pad on that side of the PCB (the
pad is positioned “inside” the pins of SW2).
?  Align the PCB with the front panel. The next part is
probably the trickiest part of the whole rig assembly. You
need to ensure that SW1 and SW2 poke through the front
panel roughly in the center of their small holes. At the
same time, you need to align the RIT pot, VR2, so that it
sits flat against the PCB. It helps to loosely fit the nuts to
the pot shafts during this operation. Also, you need to
ensure the front and rear panels sit flat (using a known flat
surface to check), otherwise the top and bottom of the case
will not fit correctly later. Care to the alignment at this stage
is crucial to the final fit of the panels.
?  Once you are happy with the alignment of the switches
and VR2, solder the center lug of VR2 to the PCB, then

take another long hard look at the front panel alignment. Is
the PCB more or less at right angles to the front panel? Is
there a large gap between the PCB and the front panel?
There should be no gap. Are the switches off center? Does
the rig sit flat on a flat surface? This is your last chance to
adjust the alignment of the panel, since you only have one
lug soldered in and you can re-flow that joint to adjust
everything.
?  Once you are entirely happy with the alignment of the
controls then go ahead and solder them all into the PCB. If
you are using the 1 turn pot supplied with the kit for the
TUNE pot, VR1, one of its lugs will need bending over
slightly to make contact (in the large hole) before it can be
soldered in place.
?  When everything is in place and soldered up, tighten the
nuts on the pots a little more. You can disassemble the
panel at any time for painting/lettering. You will need to use
a piece of discarded resistor or capacitor lead to connect
the front panel ground lug to the pad on the PCB. Do this
later when you have the piece of wire available. You will be
reminded.
Section 4 - Regulators/Power Supply
Components
?  Insert and solder U2, U8, D1, C9-12, C91-93 and C95.
These components are on sheets 1 and 5 of the circuit
diagram.
?  Connect a suitable (13.8V nominal) power supply to the
power input jack J4 whilst measuring the input current on a
meter (set to 50mA FSD or thereabouts). Turn on the
power. The input current should be no more than 10mA. If
it is just a little more than this, up to, say double, then you
may have a problem with the actual voltage regulators U2
or U8 and further detailed investigation will be necessary. If
all is well (typically see about 8mA), then turn off, connect
the power up directly without the meter and turn on again.
With the meter set to read DC Volts (20V range or
thereabouts), measure the voltages at the following points
(red lead or +) with respect to GND (black lead or -):
?  J4 center pin (at the rear of J4) - should be the same as
the supply voltage (+13.8V)
?  D1 cathode (bar end - the wire facing the front of the rig)
- should be about 0.3V less than the power supply rail
(+13.5V)
?  U9 pin 1 (square pad) - should be between +4.75 and
+5.25V  (+5V +/- 0.25V)
?  Q2 drain (Q2 pin nearest U2) - should be between +7.6
and +8.4V (+8V +/- 0.4V)
If you don’t see these voltages there is a problem. Look for
short circuits between tracks, particularly between the pins
of U2 and U8. Sometimes tiny silvers of metal can be
made when this type of component is inserted into a PCB,
this can short pins together on the topside of the PCB, so
make sure to look there too. If there is no solder bridging
and everything is soldered correctly, then suspect a defect
in  the voltage regulators.
Section 5 - VFO
?  The first component to fit is the VFO main tuned circuit
inductor, L1. Locate the T50-7 toroid core (item 96, white,
bigger than the others), the 26awg wire (the thickest
enameled wire, red, item 127), the two black fiber shoulder
washers (Item 110), the 6-32 x 1/2” nylon screw (item 111)
and the 6-32 nut for it (item 112). Cut 28” of the wire.
?  Holding the T50-7 core in your left hand, with the white
face up, with your right hand, thread about 2” of one end of
the wire through the core from the top to the bottom away
from you. Wrap the long end of the wire around the toroid
and thread it up through the toroid from the bottom to
complete the second turn (the first turn was when you
pushed the wire through at the start). Holding the short end
of the wire tight against the toroid body with your left hand,
pull the long end of the wire tight with your right hand so
the winding is kept tight and each turn is placed beside the
previous. Each pass through the center of the toroid is 1
turn.
?  Continue adding turns like this up to turn number 8. At
the “end” of turn number 8, you need to bend the long end
of the wire back double on itself to make a 2” tap. With the
wire bent back on itself, grab the small loop that is formed
and twist the tap many times around so that it forms what
looks like a single wire. Make sure you twist it real tight so
that the twists go all the way back to the body of the toroid.
Then, take the long end of the wire again, passing it up
through the bottom of the toroid to form turn number 9.
?  Continue adding turns till you have 35 of them on the
toroid all nice and tightly wound. Loose windings will allow
changes in the inductance to occur which will affect the
frequency stability of your VFO. 35 turns fit just snug on
this toroid. Make sure they are evenly spaced. Here is how
your L1 should look at this point:

Completed L1 Toroid
(Prior to cutting off the TAP loop)
At this point, some constructors may choose to bake their
L1 in a very low oven or boil it in water for a time. Do
whatever you think you need to do in order to anneal the
copper. This may or may not affect the overall frequency
stability of the final VFO - I have seen no proof one way or
the other. If you do “cook” your L1, please allow it to
completely cool and make sure it is dry before soldering it
into place.
?  L1 is fitted as per the drawing below. The HOT, TAP and
GND connections are all marked on the PCB. The holes for
the wires are almost directly below where they come off the
toroid. You will have to cut the small loop end off the tap to
fit it through the hole in the board.
L1 Assembly
?  You can either cut and tin the wire ends before you
insert them into the PCB or after they are inserted. Let us
assume you are going to tin the wire before you insert it
into the PCB. The magnet wire supplied with the kit has an
insulation that will burn off easily at soldering iron
temperatures. To tin the wire, take a hot soldering iron with
a clean, wetted (with solder) tip, and, starting at the very
end of each wire, apply the iron and feed in solder (be
generous, the excess will stay on the iron). As the wire’s
insulation burns off, run the iron down the wire to the length
you need tinned. When you have finished tinning the end,
clean off the excess solder from the iron and run it along
the wire again, from the junction of the tinned part and the
insulated part to the end. This will wipe any excess solder
off the wire and ensure it is easily inserted in the PCB hole.
Sometimes a small blob of melted insulation material forms
at the junction with the tinned part. To remove this, simply
run your fingernail over it and it will crack right off neatly.
?  With the 6-32 nylon screw fitted from the underside of
the PCB, place a fiber shoulder washer on it, followed by
the inductor L1, being careful to make sure L1’s wires are
inserted in the correct holes, then add the second fiber
shoulder washer and the nylon nut to finish. The nylon
screw and nut should only be tightened a little: just enough
to hold L1 in place without moving. Any excess pressure
exerted by this screw will result in possible loss of VFO
stability as temperature changes.
?  Finish off the L1 assembly by trimming and soldering the
HOT, TAP and GND connections on the PCB underside.
?  Insert and solder C5 before fitting TC1. It’s much easier
this way!
?  Next, insert TC1. Make sure this trimmer capacitor is the
right way around. Follow the PCB silk screen legend. The
moving vanes (connected to the screw slot) should be
grounded. Ensure TC1 is fully pushed flat to the PCB
before soldering it in place.
?  Insert and solder C108, C6 and C107 being careful not
to overheat these last two - they are polystyrene capacitors
and will melt easily.
?  Insert and solder C7, R11, D4, Q2, C8 and R12. Use
one of the discarded resistor leads to connect the front
panel ground lug to the PCB GND pad.
?  Referring to sheet 4 of the circuit diagram, insert and
solder C86, R81, D23 and C87. This is the built-in RF
probe that we are going to use to test some of the circuits.
?  Find a 5” piece of scrap hook-up wire to use as a
jumper. Connect it from the junction of C8 and R12 to the
anode of D23 (that’s the junction of D23, R81 and C86). If
you don’t have any hook-up wire, use a 5” piece of the 26-
awg magnet wire provided with the kit, but don’t throw it
away afterwards, you’ll need it again. Connect power to the
rig and turn it on.
?  Using your meter set to a low voltage range (DC, 2V
range is good), measure the voltage between GND (black
probe or -) and the RF test point on the PCB (red probe or
+). You should get between +0.5V and +1.5V. This means

the VFO is producing RF nicely. Don’t worry about the
frequency of the VFO for the moment.
?  If you don’t get any voltage here you have something
wrong in the VFO circuitry. Go back over and check your
work, look for solder bridges (90% of all problems!) or
components in the wrong way.
If you have access to an oscilloscope, you can probe the
same point as the hook-up wire is connected to. You
should see a nice clean 1 to 1.5V peak-to-peak sinewave
of around about 5MHz.
Section 6 - VFO Buffer-Amp
?  Insert and solder Q3, Q4, R13-18, C13-15, C66 and
C67.
?  Connect the 5” piece of scrap hook-up wire from the
junction of C15 and U3 pin 4 to the anode of D23 (that’s
the junction of D23, R81 and C86). Connect power to the
rig and turn it on.
?  Using your meter set to a low voltage range (DC, 2V
range is good), measure the voltage between GND (black
or -) and the RF test point on the PCB (red or +). You
should get somewhere between +1V and +2V. This means
the buffer/amp is doing its job properly.
Section 7 - TUNE and RIT controls
?  Insert and solder Q1, D2, U1, R1-8, R10, R100, C1-4
and D3 to the PCB. Note that resistors R1, R3, R4, R6 and
R7 are 1% tolerance parts.
?  R9 should be selected depending on which TUNE pot
type you are going to use. For a 1 turn pot, R9 needs to be
100K?  and for a 10 turn pot, R9 needs to be 220K? . Both
values are supplied with the kit. Choose the correct R9 for
your TUNE pot and insert and solder it in now. You also
need to insert and solder two small link wires (use some
discarded resistor leads) to select the type of TUNE pot
you are using. To the left of the TUNE pot, as you are
looking at the front of the radio, are two sets of links
labeled 1t and 10t. You need to make the appropriate two
links for your TUNE pot type. These links swap the two
ends of the pot around electrically. This has to be done like
this because the 1 turn pot and 10 turn pot tune in opposite
directions from each other! These links ensure the TUNE
control has the correct ergonomic sense (that is, turning
the control clockwise means the frequency goes up).
?  Once you have fitted all the above parts, connect power
to the rig and turn it on.
?  Using your meter set to the 20V DC range (or
thereabouts), with the black lead (-) to GND, probe the
voltage at U1 pin 6 (the junction of U1 pin 6 and R10). Vary
the TUNE control from fully counter-clockwise to fully
clockwise and note the measured voltage at each extreme.
?  For a 1 turn TUNE pot, the voltage should vary from
about +3V to about +6.5V. A little either way will not be a
problem; you just need to find out if the voltage is varying
as you tune.
?  For a 10 turn TUNE pot, the voltage should vary from
about +2V to about +10V. Again, a little either way is not a
problem here.
?  Depending on the accuracy of your meter, try varying the
RIT pot and see if the voltage at U1 pin 6 varies at all. We
will be testing the RIT pot more fully later, so don’t worry if
you can’t do this test now. The voltage should vary by
about +/- 0.1V using the 1 turn TUNE pot and by about +/-
0.2V using the 10 turn TUNE pot (actually, it’s the different
R9 values that make these voltage swings different, not the
TUNE pot type!).
Section 8 - Audio Amplifier
?  Insert and solder U6, C56-62, R57 and R58.
?  Connect a suitable loudspeaker or set of headphones to
J1 then connect power and turn the rig on. You may hear a
small click from the speaker/phones upon turn-on. Rotate
the volume control VR4 fully clockwise. Using a small piece
of wire or a small screwdriver blade, touch the ungrounded
end connection of VR4 (the right most terminal as you look
at the radio front).
?  You should hear crackling and buzzing from the
speaker/phones.
Section 9 - Audio Pre-Amplifier
?  Insert and solder U5, Q9, C43-55, R44-51, R53-56 and
D13-15. Note that R52 is included for test, setup and
modification purposes and is not soldered in at this time.
Experimenters may like to use an 8-pin DIL socket (not
supplied) for U5 to allow experimentation with super-low
noise (expensive) op-amps later.

?  Connect up the loudspeaker/phones and power-up the
radio again. With the volume control fully clockwise, dab
your test wire/screwdriver tip onto the pads for U4 pins 4
and 5 respectively.
?  
You 
should 
hear 
crackling/buzzing 
from 
the
speaker/phones again, but this time it should sound
“bandwidth limited” since it’s going through a sharp 700Hz
bandpass filter. Compare it to the sound you get by
dabbing on the volume control pot directly and you should
easily be able to hear the difference.
?  The maximum volume the radio can generate is set with
R56 (47K? ). The standard level (as shipped) is set so that
for most small speakers and stereo headphones there is
no chance of eardrum busting audio from the rig! Thus it is
set lower than some constructors may like. If, when you
have completed the construction, you find the maximum
audio output a little limited, you can change R56 for lower
value (e.g. I use R56 = 33K?  in my prototype rigs, since I
like to use it with a 5W surplus mobile radio loudspeaker
that needs just a bit of extra output to drive it).
Section 10 - Audible Frequency Annunciator
(AFA)
?  Insert and solder U10, Q22, Q23, D27, C97-104, C106,
R86-96, VR8 and X8. Be especially careful when soldering
X8 into the board as it is extremely tiny and fragile. It is a
good idea to hold it in place with a dab of hot glue or wax
after you have soldered it to the board. Note that R92 is
near the front of the PCB, next to the AFA mode setting
links LK1-4.
?  You now have to make another decision. That is, do you
want the AFA to operate in Auto mode, Manual mode,
have a switch to change modes on the fly or a set of 0.1”
headers with jumpers to allow occasional changes to be
effected?
?  Four links are provided on the PCB to facilitate any of
the above choices, LK1-4. They are positioned so that a
small DPDT slide switch will fit the holes. A suitable part is
E-Switch 
(http://www.e-switch.com) 
part 
number
500SDP1M2QEA 
or 
500SDP1M2REA 
(Mouser 
part
numbers 612-500-D121 and 612-500-D122 respectively).
These can be fitted on either side of the PCB. If you fit it to
the topside, you will only have access to it when you
remove the lid of the radio (4 screws). If you fit it to the
underside of the PCB you will be able to change modes
quite easily from the underside of the rig. You will have to
cut a small rectangular hole in the bottom of the case to
allow access to the slide switch if you choose this method.
?  If you choose to panel mount a DPDT switch, either on
the front or rear panels, you can use just about any DPDT
switch you have to hand and wire it pin-for-pin back to the
6 holes on the PCB. It was not feasible to place another
switch directly on the front or rear of the PCB, so this
switch will have to be panel mounted and wired up
manually if you need access to it directly on either the front
or rear panels.
?  If you only want to change the AFA mode very
occasionally, or if you just want to try each mode for a
while to see what your preference is, then you may
consider putting two small 3-pin 0.1” spacing “headers” into
the LK1-4 holes. You can then use two 0.1” jumper blocks
(just like they use on computer boards to configure the
IRQ/Address etc.) to set the mode.
?  Alternatively, if you know which mode you want already,
just go ahead and solder small wire links into the PCB. Use
two links. For Auto mode, solder the links into LK1 and
LK3, for manual mode, solder the links into LK2 and LK4.
You can use two discarded resistor leads for the links.
?  Set the volume control to about half way, the tune
control to minimum and the trimpot VR8 to about 1/3
clockwise from fully counter-clockwise. Connect the
loudspeaker/phones and power-up the radio. Press the
AFA announce push-button SW2. You should hear an
announcement in the speaker/phones in Morse code at
about 1800Hz. The announcement may be one of three
things:
a) ‘0’ in which case there is something wrong with the
VFO signal getting to the AFA
b) ‘xxx’, a three digit number (e.g. 965) in which case
the VFO needs adjustment
c) ‘xx’, a two digit number (e.g. 14) in which case the
VFO still needs adjustment!
The next section deals with the tuning of the VFO.
Section 11 - Setting the VFO Frequency
?  If the AFA announcement is a three-digit number like
‘965’ this means the VFO is too low in frequency and is
actually at 4.965MHz. It is just possible that the VFO could
be too high, say at 5.116MHz for example, in which case
the AFA will announce ‘116’. You need to adjust the VFO’s
trimmer capacitor TC1 so that the lowest frequency (with
the TUNE pot fully counter-clockwise) is what you want it to
be. In most cases you will want the lowest VFO frequency
to be 5.000MHz. It’s a good idea to set the lowest

============================================================
PAGE 15
============================================================

                        ?  1999, AD6A – Unauthorized Copying or Publication Prohibited
11
frequency to ‘999’ so you can guarantee full coverage of
the low end of the band.
?  Some constructors who use the 1 turn TUNE pot may
like to have the rig operate around the US QRP calling
frequency of 14.060MHz. Since with the 1 turn pot you
have about a 30KHz tuning range, set the pot to mid-point
and then tune the VFO to ‘60’ exactly.
?  If you are in AFA Auto mode the AFA will announce
frequencies as you tune TC1, each time you stop. Notice
that you will also hear ‘pips’ as you tune through each KHz.
In manual mode, you will need to press the AFA’s
announce push-button SW2 every time you want to know
the frequency.
?  Set VR8 to the level you find comfortable to listen too.
This will depend on your personal preference and what
mode you have the AFA set to. It is adjustable from nothing
up to very loud, catering to all tastes.
Section 12 - Keyer and Transmit Control
?  Insert and solder U9, Q19-21, C88-90, C94, C96, R82-
85, R97-99, VR7 and D24-26. You may like to put U9 in an
8-pin DIL socket (not supplied) to make upgrading to the
Embedded Research Super TiCK III keyer (with memory) a
lot easier later. Make sure you insert U9 the correct way
round. The label makes it difficult to see the “indent” in the
package that identifies the end with pin 1.
?  Set the volume control at half way and the keyer
sidetone level control VR7 to about 1/3 clockwise from fully
counter-clockwise. Connect up the loudspeaker/phones
and power-up the radio again. This time when you turn-on
the power you should hear a ‘dit-dit’ in the speaker/phones
at the sidetone frequency of about 700Hz. This tells you
that the TiCK keyer powered up correctly. The ‘dit-dit’ that
you hear is the version of TiCK. If you were to plug in a
Super TiCK III instead, you’d hear ‘dit-dit-dit dah’ for “s t”.
?  Power off the rig, connect a set of paddles to J3 and
then turn the power back on. Operate your paddles to
check both the dit and dah works. Don’t worry if they are
the wrong way round at the moment, we’ll get to that later.
Press the TiCK programming push-button SW1 and hold it.
?  You should hear the programming menu sequence of
the TiCK keyer ‘s t p a sk m k’ in the speaker/phones. This
will repeat if you hold SW1 continuously. The TiCK keyer
programming instructions are included in an appendix at
the end of the manual.
?  Connect your meter (set to 20V DC range or
thereabouts) from GND (black or - lead) to the +12VTX
signal at the junction of R98 and C94 (red or + lead). You
can get at this signal easiest on the looped end of the wire
on R98 on the topside of the PCB. At the moment, the
meter should read 0V.
?  Press the TiCK programming button and hold it until you
hear ‘s t’ then let go. This puts the rig into tune-up mode
(continuous transmit). You should hear a continuous
sidetone at this time. The meter should now read about
+13.3V. This tests the transmit switching. Hit either the dit
or dah paddle or SW1 again to stop the tune-up mode. If
you have access to a ‘scope, you can try looking at the
+12VTX signal as you send with the paddles. Notice the
linear rise and fall waveform that contributes to clean,
minimum bandwidth use on the band.
?  Next you have another decision to make. Are the
paddles the right way around for you? You probably
already have paddles that are wired up to your liking. The
“standard” wiring method is with DIT to the tip of the stereo
plug, but there is no “standard” that says which paddle that
has to be!!! For this reason, there is a way for you to
electrically swap the paddles over so that when you first
turn the rig on, they will be right for you.
?  Of course, you can re-program the TiCK to swap the
paddles over any time you like, but this information is lost
at power off time. This feature is nice for guest operators
who have different dit/dah preferences to you, but is a pain
if it’s your radio and you have to program the TiCK every
time you turn it on!
?  On the PCB, right behind the paddle jack J3 you will see
two sets of 4 holes in a row. There are two links labeled
‘DIT’ and ‘DAH’, plus two pairs of holes labeled ‘Cap’. The
capacitor holes are there just in case you need to keep RF
out of your rig - they decouple the dit and dah lines to GND
- they will not normally be required at QRP power levels.
1000pF or 0.01?F capacitors (not supplied) can be used
here but only fit them if they are really needed. The DIT
and DAH links have thin PCB traces on the underside of
the board. If the paddles are the wrong way round (for you)
at power-up, cut the thin traces carefully and, using two
insulated jumper wires soldered into the PCB holes, swap
the paddles over by crossing the links.
Section 13 - Receiver
?  First you are going to fit the crystals X1-6. Before you
insert each crystal, tin its metal case near the bottom of
one end with your soldering iron. Do this as quickly as

12
possible - you should be able to tin it fast enough that you
can hold the crystal’s metal case with one hand while you
do the tinning, and not get burned. Insert each crystal with
the tinned end at the same end as its GND pad. Solder
each crystal into the board using the minimum amount of
soldering time/heat possible, then take a discarded resistor
lead and make a connection from the GND pad for each
crystal to the tinned area on the end of the crystal. The
GND pads are not marked on the PCB legend – they are at
one end of each crystal and are obvious.
The trick to getting a neat looking job with no excess solder
on the top of the PCB is to push the wire through the board
then bend it over at 90 degrees underneath and solder it
underneath the PCB first. Then move to the topside, cut
the wire to length, bend it toward the crystal case and
solder it quickly to the point you previously tinned.
Grounding each of the crystal cases greatly improves the
IF stop band attenuation.
?  At this time, it also makes sense to fit the transmit crystal
X7 to the board using the same technique as you did to fit
X1-6. You do not have to do this now - you will be
reminded later during the transmitter construction phase.
?  Next, insert and solder TC2-6. Please take care to insert
them the correct way around as per the silk screen legend
on the PCB. This ensures the part where you insert your
screwdriver/trimmer tool is connected to GND (except TC2
and TC6 of course), that will make tuning up the receiver
much easier.
?  Next, insert and solder U3, U4, Q5-8, Q13, L2, L4, C16-
42, C64, R19-43, R67-69, D5-12 and D17-18. Take care
not to mix up D12, the 1N754A zener diode, with the
1N914 diodes - they look basically the same! When fitting
Q6, the 2N4427, place the TO-5 standoff insulator over the
legs of the transistor before inserting it into the board.
Raising this transistor off the ground plane helps reduce
conduction of heat to the VFO. When Q6 is soldered in
place, take the TO-5 finned heatsink and push it over the
transistor case as far as it will go. This requires some
pressure but can be done just with the hands (no tools -
they will scratch the transistor case) using a good firm
push.
The TFM-2 mixer (U3) has a blue insulation material
around pin 1.
Lastly, you need to wind and fit the receiver toroids. Each
receiver toroid is different so make sure you don’t mix them
up. The best way to ensure this is to fit each one to the
PCB as soon as it is wound. Remember to keep count of
the turns and not get distracted. Each time the wire passes
through the center of the toroid it counts as one turn. For
each turn, pull the long end of the wire tight to ensure a
tightly wound toroid overall.
?  T1 and T2 are almost the same - T1 has a 2 turn link (its
primary) while T2 has a 4 turn link (its secondary). Both T1
and T2 use T37-6 toroid cores. Cut two 13” pieces of red
28awg (item 129) wire for the main 21 turn windings of
both T1 and T2. Cut a 3” piece of red 28awg (item 129) for
the 2 turn link winding on T1 and a 4” piece of red 28awg
(item 129) for the 4 turn link winding on T2.
T2 is shown below, T1 looks essentially the same and is
wound in exactly the same way. Notice that the link
winding starts and finishes on the same side of the toroid
as the main 21 turn winding. This will require you to start
the link winding by pushing the wire up through the center
of the toroid from below - the opposite to how you started
the main winding off. This can be a little awkward to do
physically, but with a little perseverance you will find that
it’s not too hard to do neatly. The windings are done this
way to a) ensure correct insertion into the PCB (this way
around, there’s no doubt which wire goes in which hole)
and b) to make the PCB easier to lay out.
Completed T2
(T1 is the same except it has a 2 turn
link winding, not 4 turns)
?  L3 uses a T37-2 toroid core. Cut 11” of red 26awg (item
127) wire and wind 16 turns onto the toroid:

?  T3 uses an FT37-43 toroid core. Cut two 9” pieces of
26awg wire, one red (item 127) and the other green (item
128) and, keeping them neatly side by side, wind 10 bifilar
turns onto the toroid:
Completed T3
To ensure correct phasing of the windings, the wire ends
should be Red-Green-Red-Green as you look at the
transformer (from left to right in the picture).
?  T4 uses an FT37-43 toroid core. Cut 8” of red 26awg
wire (item 127) for the main winding of 11 turns and 3” of
red 26awg wire (item 127) for the link winding of 2 turns:
Completed T4
?  Temporarily connect a short (about 1.5”) piece of hookup
wire, or piece of 26awg wire from the kit, from the antenna
input (junction of J2 and C86) to the receiver input (junction
of TC2 and C79). Connect a 20m antenna (a simple dipole
will do) to J2. Connect a speaker/phones to the rig. Set the
RF Attenuator on the rear panel fully clockwise (as you
look at the rear panel) for minimum attenuation. Set the
receiver trimcaps TC2-5 to half way. Connect power to the
rig and turn it on. You should hear noise from the receiver.
?  Starting with the product detector, adjust TC6 so that the
noise is just a little above zero beat frequency wise and
suits your taste. When you are able to receive a carrier,
check that when tuning up the band (clockwise), the audio
frequency goes from high to low – this is the correct (lower)
sideband.
?  Adjust TC5 for maximum perceived noise then adjust
TC2/3/4 likewise. You may need to go over and re-adjust
all these trimcaps several times to hear anything in the way
of atmospheric noise from the antenna. Persevere - when
you have adjusted all the receiver tuned circuits for
maximum received noise, you should be able to hear a
distinct difference in the noise level when the antenna is
unplugged and plugged back in again. If possible, find a
weak signal in the center of your rig’s tuning range and
tune the receiver for best reception. Of course, you can
use a signal generator if you have access to one.
?  Test the receiver muting by pressing and holding the
TiCK programming push-button SW1. Wait until you hear ‘s
t’ in the speaker/phones then let go. The rig will then go
into tune-up mode. You should hear sidetone but no
receiver noise. Press SW1 or one of the paddles to go
back to receive mode.
Section 14 - AGC
?  Insert and solder Q10-12, D16, D19-21, VR5, C63, C65,
R59-66 and R101.
?  Disconnect the antenna from J2. With a speaker/phones
connected, power up the rig. Measure the AGC2 voltage
on the test pad labeled ‘S’ next to X6 - connect your meter
(set to the 20V DC range or thereabouts) with black (-) to
GND and red (+) to the ‘S’ test pad. Adjust VR5 to get
+5.5V at this point. Because of FET variations, different
radios will exhibit different VR5 behavior. Set AGC2 to the
first +5.5V you encounter as the trimpot is turned clockwise
from fully anticlockwise.
?  The attenuators in the AGC2 circuit start to attenuate at
about +5V, so the idle voltage (no signal) needs to be set
slightly above to allow for temperature variation and to
ensure maximum receiver gain for weak signal reception.
?  Test the “AGC disable during transmit” feature by
pressing SW1 (TiCK programming). Hold SW1 until you
hear ‘s t’ in the speaker/phones then let go and the rig
should go into tune-up mode. Measure the AGC2 voltage
again. It should be 0V. Press SW1 or one of the paddles to
go back to receive mode.
?  Be sure to remove the link wire from the antenna
connection to the receiver input before proceeding.
Section 15 - Transmitter
?  First fit the output RF power transistor to the rear panel.
You will need the TO-220 insulating washer (item 102), a
nylon 6-32 screw (item 104), a metal 6-32 nut (item 105)

============================================================
PAGE 18

                        ?  1999, AD6A – Unauthorized Copying or Publication Prohibited
14
and, of course, the 2SC1969 power transistor (item 86) to
accomplish this. Note there is no need for silicone grease
or any other heat transfer cream or agent here. The TO-
220 insulation washer supplied is specially designed to be
“dry” fitted. This makes things a lot easier and cleaner to
do, especially since, once you have the radio working
correctly, you will probably want to remove the front and
rear panels for painting.
?  Insert, but do not solder, Q18 into the PCB. Place the
TO-220 insulating washer between the rear panel and
Q18’s heatsink tab, then insert the nylon 6-42 screw
through from the outward facing side of the rear panel, the
insulating washer and the transistor (in that order). Fit the
6-32 nut to the nylon screw and tighten the whole
assembly with a screwdriver. Notice that the 6-32 nut will
“self-lock” on the body of the transistor - it’s just the right
size to do this. The nylon screw thread will strip easily, so
do not overtighten it. When Q18 is in position and secured,
solder it into the PCB.
?  Next insert and solder C76-78 and R80. These parts are
close to the rear panel, so fitting them now will ease
construction.
?  If you didn’t fit crystal X7 along with crystals X1-6 earlier,
you need to do so now. Insert and solder crystal X7 the
same way you used when fitting X1-6 in section 13
(receiver) above.
?  Then insert and solder U7, Q14-17, D22, TC7-9, L5,
C68-75, C79-85, C105, R70-79 and VR6. Identify the
transmit output filter capacitors carefully - the writing on
them is very small - you may need a magnifying glass to
make them easier to read. Note also that C79 is a 100V
component with radial leads, not like the rest of the axial
leaded 0.1?F decoupling capacitors.
Lastly, the fun part, winding the transmitter toroids. Here
are the details:
?  T5 and T6 use a T37-2 toroid core. Cut 12” of red 28awg
wire (item 129) for the main 18 turn windings and 3” of red
28awg wire (item 129) for the 2 turn link windings:
Completed T5
(T6 is the same)
?  T7 uses a T37-2 toroid core. Cut 8” of red 26awg wire
(item 127) for the main 13 turn winding and 4” of red
26awg wire (item 127) for the 3 turn link winding:
Completed T7
?  T8 uses an FT37-43 toroid core. Cut two 9” pieces of
26awg wire, one red (item 127) and one green (item 128)
and, keeping them neatly side by side, wind 10 bifilar turns
onto the toroid:
Completed T8
To ensure correct phasing of the windings, the wire ends
should be Red-Green-Red-Green as you look at the
transformer (from left to right in the picture).
?  L6 and L7 use T37-2 toroid cores. Cut 9” of red 26awg
wire (item 127) for 10 turns on L6 and 8” of red 26awg wire
(item 127) for 9 turns on L7:
Completed L6
(L7 is the same, but with 1 turn less)

                        ?  1999, AD6A – Unauthorized Copying or Publication Prohibited
15
?  Connect a speaker/phones, an antenna and a set of
paddles. Set VR6 and TC7-9 at their half way points.
Connect your meter to the RF probe circuit at the
transmitter output as before (meter on 20V DC range or
thereabouts). Connect up the power and turn on. Tune the
rig to mid-band.
?  Re-peak the receiver tuning using TC2-4. You may have
to go round the trimmers several times to get the best peak
possible (incremental improvement). When you are happy
with it, turn the rig off and connect a suitable 50?  resistive
dummy load to the antenna jack instead of the antenna. If
you do not have a suitable dummy load, first make sure
your antenna represents a good 50?  resistive load to the
radio (using a tuner), then find a clear frequency
somewhere mid-band, listen for several minutes to make
sure the frequency is dead. If it is clear, use this frequency
to set the rig up. This is a last resort method. Even if you
can find a 50?  1W carbon resistor, you would be better off
tuning the transmitter up into that rather than an antenna.
?  Using the TiCK programming push-button, SW1, set the
rig into tune-up mode (continuous TX – ‘s t’). You should
hear the continuous sidetone in the speaker/phones. If you
are lucky, you will also see a small voltage reading on the
meter. If you do, then you merely have to peak the reading
using TC8 and TC9.
?  Use the power control, VR6, to keep the maximum
reading to around +4 to 5V on the meter. This will ensure
the transmitter is easy to tune. Like many QRP transmit
amplifier strip designs, it is much easier to find the tuning
peaks while the power is kept to around the 1 to 2W level.
If you don’t see any reading on your meter, keep twiddling
TC8 and TC9. Try both ends of the capacitance range
and/or try setting the output power higher using VR6
temporarily to see if you can obtain a reading.
?  The trimmer capacitors supplied with the kit either have
a pointer or a tiny indentation (dot) that shows you where
they are in their capacitance range. When the pointer, or
dot, points to the flat end of the trimcap’s body, that’s
minimum capacitance. When it points to the opposite end,
that’s maximum capacitance. There are two ways to get
from minimum to maximum capacitance, so that’s why you
should always see two peaks in the tuning. If you don’t see
two peaks, something is wrong with the tuning. This is true
for the filter receiver front-end filter (TC2-4) as well as the
transmitter.
?  Once you have peaked the transmitter tuned circuits at
the 1 to 2W level, you can simply adjust VR6 to set the
output power from nothing (0W) to around 6 or 7W. The
maximum power available will depend heavily on the gain
of the devices in your radio. Unfortunately, the output
power monitor probe circuit is not calibrated in any way, so
a direct relationship to the reading you obtain and the
power level actually transmitted is not possible. The meter
type used will also have a large effect on the readings
obtained. Older analog meters with as low as 10K? /V input
resistance will show much smaller readings than modern
DMM’s. As a reference point, using my Fluke 75 series
DMM, at 5W output my meter reads +9.3V on the probe
output. There are two sure ways to set the power output to
5W (exact enough for QRP purposes). The first is to use a
calibrated power meter (such as the Stockton Wattmeter
from Kanga or the Oak Hills Research WM-1 or WM-2
QRP Wattmeters). The second is to run the transmitter into
a good dummy load then use a calibrated oscilloscope to
measure the RF voltage at the load and convert it to Watts.
To save you the trouble with the math, 4.95W output is
44.5V peak-to-peak into 50? .
If you cannot get at least 5W out of the transmitter, then
you might start looking at the various critical devices in the
transmit chain to see if a swap out may improve things.
Start with the VFO FET (Q2, J310) - we have found that
some FETs exhibit lower gain and produce less VFO
output. If you have access to an oscilloscope, try checking
the VFO output level. You should see about 4V peak to
peak at Q3’s collector. Please contact NorCal if you need a
replacement FET.
?  When you are happy with the power output setting, you
need to set up the transmit frequency offset. This is set
using TC7. Turn off the power to the rig and temporarily
insert R52 (1M? ) or the other spare resistor (100K?  or
220K? ). You can simply push it into the PCB holes without
soldering it for this test. Power the rig on again. Press and
hold the TiCK programming push-button SW1 until you
hear ‘s t p a’ then let go. Hit the dit paddle to turn the TiCK
sidetone OFF. When you transmit now, you should not
hear any TiCK sidetone: you will hear real sidetone from
the receiver.
?  Press and hold SW1 again until you hear ‘s t’ then let go.
This will put the rig into tune-up mode again. Set the
volume control to maximum. Using an insulated adjustment
tool (a sharpened/shaped stick end will do), adjust TC7
until you hear your “real” sidetone at the frequency *you*
want the offset to be. This will be your real transmit offset
regardless of the sidetone frequency from the TiCK (which
is about 700Hz). To make zero beating with received
stations simple, it is best to set the transmit offset to the
same frequency as the TiCK sidetone, or very close.
Remove the temporary R52 when you are done.
?  If you really don’t like the fixed frequency sidetone from
the TiCK and prefer to hear “real” sidetone, you can insert

============================================================

16
a resistor into the R52 position permanently. 1M?  is too
high for this purpose. Start with 100K and adjust from
there. A miniature 470K?  pot for R52 would allow you to
adjust the level to your liking easily. Of course, since the
TiCK always powers up with sidetone enabled, you will
have to disable it every time you power on your rig. This
only takes a couple of seconds to do, so may be worth it:
you decide.
Section 16 - Conclusion
At this point you should have a working NorCal 20
transceiver on your workbench. If it doesn’t work, you will
need to spend some time troubleshooting using the
included guide (Appendix A). This shows typical voltages
around the radio as well as signal levels expected. Simply
running through the table till you find a mismatch between
typical and your rig should allow you to pinpoint the
problem fast.
If you followed the manual to build your radio, there should
be no way that you let the smoke out of any of the devices
in it. If you didn’t follow the manual and have let the smoke
out of one or more devices, you should be able to find the
culprit/s quite quickly using the troubleshooting guide.
The number one problem with newly built kits is solder
bridging between pins and the number two problem is pins
not soldered (either badly or not at all). Take some time to
check the rig thoroughly for these two things before you
pronounce it dead! When you are convinced that the
soldering is good, have someone else check it again -
often the builder of a rig cannot see a problem as they are
too close to it and “can’t see the forest for the trees”.
You will probably want to fine tune everything again and
set the TiCK and AFA levels to suit your operating
practices as well as make several simple modifications.
Some modifications were planned for (pads put onto the
PCB). These are described in Appendix B. The simplest
modification by far is the TiCK upgrade to the Super TiCK
with memories and beacon mode (see advertisement at
the front of the manual).
You can simply fit the top and bottom case panels and use
the rig as it is or spend some time and effort to paint and
decorate the radio to your liking. If you want a really good
looking case don’t forget the black anodized and machine
engraved cases available from the San Luis Machine
Company (see advertisement at the front of the manual).
Lastly, please send me details of any other modifications,
improvements or problems you find with the rig, I’d love to
hear about them. Email me at AD6A@qsl.net with the
subject line “NorCal 20 Feedback”.
Have fun operating your newly built NorCal 20 rig.
72, Dave Fifield, AD6A

Appendix B – Modifications/Experimentation
TiCK upgrade
The NorCal 20 uses the basic TiCK keyer device. Users
may upgrade this to the latest SuperTiCK or TiCK III from
Embedded Research easily – the upgrade part is a drop-in
replacement for the TiCK. The SuperTiCK provides extra
features such as memories and beacon mode. An order
form is provided for your convenience at the front of this
manual.
Straight Key Input
There are two ways to run the NorCal 20 using a straight
key. The first is simply to make up a special cable or
adapter for your straight key, so that it can be plugged
straight into the existing paddle jack socket. The second is
to mount another jack socket, that matches your straight
key’s jack, on the rear panel (say, just below the existing
paddle socket) and wire it to the DIT or DAH input of the
TiCK.
There is a test pad labeled ‘K’ on the board where you
could connect an external keyer or straight key directly.
Grounding this point will cause the NorCal 20 TX to
operate, but will not generate any TiCK sidetone. “Real”
sidetone from the RX can be had by inserting an audio
“leak” resistor at R52 (approximately 100K? ).
Frequency Range
The LF351 op-amp used for U1 is a compromise device
(price/performance) and as such has some limitations. For
best results, this op-amp should be operated with the
output voltage in the region (approximately):
(Vss + 2V) < Vout < (Vdd –2V)
The NorCal 20 circuit is designed to stay within this range.
Fortunately, the characteristics of varicap diodes are such
that below about 2V, although their capacitance change is
largest, they are inherently non-linear - not very useful for a
tuning dial. Experimenters may like to substitute other op-
amps with full rail-to-rail performance (expensive) for U1, in
which case may wish to use an 8-pin Dual In-Line (DIL)
socket for this part (not supplied).
The tuning range of the rig as supplied with the 1 turn pot is
limited to about 30KHz. With a 10 turn pot and the required
changes (‘10t’ links and R9 = 220K? ) this is extended to
about 70KHz. Increasing the value of C5 can further extend
the tuning range. This capacitor must be an NPO part.
VFO output
A clean sine wave VFO output is available from the ‘V’ test
point on the board. This output is ideal for feeding LCD
frequency displays such as the K1MG DCC Kit, from Blue
Sky Engineering. A coupling capacitor is required to feed
this output (not supplied). Use the lowest possible value
you can (start with 5pF and work up), to avoid loading the
NorCal 20 VFO circuitry.
XIT/RIT
Although the NorCal 20 only has RIT as standard, it is a
relatively simple matter to add a switch to allow selection of
RIT/OFF/XIT. The switch required is a simple SPST with
center OFF position. To do this modification, cut the XIT
mod-track on the underside of the board. Then, take two
wires from the XIT holes and a third from the test point
marked ‘T’ on the board (sheet 5 of the schematic). These
three wires go to the switch. Voila, it’s done.
If you did the 10 turn pot modification, you will notice that
the RIT range will have changed from about ? 1.2KHz with
the 1 turn pot to about ? 3KHz with the 10 turn pot. This is
as a result of the gain of U1 changing from –1 to –2.2
roughly. You can change the RIT range to just about any
value you desire by changing the value of R5. Making R5
smaller will increase the RIT range and making it larger will
decrease the RIT range.
Data Modes
The NorCal 20 can be modified quite simply to add RTTY
or other data modes. Since the rig is varicap diode tuned
and the varicap is fed by a summing op-amp, any FSK
offset you desire (positive or negative) can be had by
feeding the appropriate voltage to the ‘D’ test point on the
board - via a resistor to set the gain of course. Received
audio for data recovery is available from the ‘A’ test point
on the board – PCB traces are provided to add a miniature
trimpot to vary the fixed audio output level (next to VR4)
labeled “Trimpot” and either a resistor or a capacitor in the
position labeled “R/C”. The constructor will have to supply
these parts.

Internal Loudspeaker
It is possible to use an internal loudspeaker with the NorCal
20. However, care and attention should be paid to the
effect that the magnetic field of the chosen loudspeaker will
have on the tuned circuits (toroids) in the rig. It is
recommended that the user pay due diligence by
experimenting with the chosen loudspeaker before drilling
holes in the rig’s top! I found a 3” low profile 8?  0.8W
speaker that fitted perfectly. The only effect it had on the
circuitry was to lower the VFO frequency a couple of KHz.
Your mileage may vary – experiment before drilling holes.
Headphones
Some users will notice high frequency hiss when using
sensitive hi-fi type earphones plugged directly into the
loudspeaker jack socket. This is due to the LM380 audio
amplifier. Some samples of this amplifier are worse than
others. Should this be a concern, you can add a simple RC
low pass filter to the output. A 47?  resistor in series with
the earphones with a 4.7?F capacitor in parallel across
them (as per the circuit below) will be a good starting point
– you can play with the values here to find what suits you
and your headphones.
The RC filter can be added externally, in the form of an
adapter cable assembly, or internally (permanently), either
by cutting the tracks under the loudspeaker jack socket and
adding the components to the underside of the board, or by
adding another rear panel mounted jack socket especially
for phones, with the RC filter components feeding it from
the main PCB.
AGC
There is great scope for experimentation and modification
of the AGC system in the NorCal 20. The time constants
chosen (standard values supplied) may be too long or short
for your liking. You can modify them to your heart’s content.
The value of C63 or R60 can be changed to adjust the time
constant of AGC2. Changing C63 to 0.47?F or 0.33?F is a
popular modification. The gain of the AGC2 circuits can be
altered by changing R59 (this can be made a 470K?
trimpot if you like). AGC1’s time constant is not so variable.
Capacitor C65 is the only variable here. This capacitor
needs to be quite large to keep audio out of the AGC –
horrible sounding motorboating can result if it is made too
small.
The setting of the idle level of AGC2 can be experimented
with. This level is slightly temperature sensitive – it will drift
downwards as the rig’s temperature rises. It should be set
so the AGC starts to act (i.e. the attenuators start to
attenuate) at the chosen incoming signal level. The setting
in the manual is a median, you may find it works better with
the level set higher or lower than 5.5V.
Other Bands
The NorCal 20’s architecture lends itself to conversion for
operation on several other bands, but with some caveats.
In particular, the AFA is designed to work ONLY at 5MHz. It
will NOT work at other VFO frequencies. K1MG/Blue Sky
Engineering may produce replacement AFA chips specially
designed for other common bands, but nothing is
guaranteed/promised at this time.
With some simple tuned circuit changes and a change in
the VFO frequency from 5 to 5.5MHz, the rig can work on
3.5MHz (80m). The VFO can be brought up to 5.5MHz
simply by removing a few turns from L1. The RX and TX
tuned circuit changes are left for the user to experiment
with. Since the VFO will tune “backwards” for 80m, it is a
simple matter of changing the ‘1t/10t’ links for the TUNE
pot to get the tuning control the right way round.
The rig could also be made to operate on 40m and 30m
with some more extensive VFO changes as well as the
requisite RX/TX tuned circuit changes. Remember that it
took 4 beta testers hundreds of test hours to get the VFO
temperature coefficient right for 5MHz operation – an
equivalent amount of work will be imperative if operation on
other bands is to be successful.
Operation on higher bands will require extensive changes
(highly undesirable) to the design, such as a higher IF,
which would require the crystal filter to be re-designed, and
a premixed local oscillator scheme.
Test Points
There are many test points (pads) provided on the board
and most signal points are easy to probe directly on the
relevant pin. There are also several ground points (marked
‘G’) 
provided. 
The 
user 
can 
fit 
these 
with 
test
points/headers (not supplied) to make testing/measuring
signals in the rig easier.

Warm-up period – VFO drift
There 
is 
a 
trade-off 
for 
having 
good 
receiver
performance. The receiver uses about 150mA, at 13.8V.
That’s just a little over 2 Watts! This heat has to go
somewhere. It goes into the whole rig, slowly, from
power-up. This means the VFO also sees a fairly
substantial temperature rise from power-up. The effect
has been mitigated with careful VFO design and
component choice. The overall temperature coefficient of
the VFO is quite low, but still non-zero. As a result, there
will be some small amount of VFO drift from power-up.
The worst drift will be in the first few (~5) minutes when
the VFO may drift a few hundred Hz (+200 to +400Hz is
typical). The drift slows rapidly and, once the internal
temperature has stabilized, at around 30 minutes,
becomes almost negligible at around +30 to 50Hz per
hour. Of course, local environmental conditions will have
a lot to do with the actual drift experienced so your
mileage may vary. In reality, this drift is a whole lot better
than some other radios currently on the market.
Experimenters may like to optimize their particular rig for
minimum 
possible 
temperature 
coefficient. 
Two
capacitors, the combination of C6 in series with C107,
and C108 are the components to adjust. Try more
polystyrene capacitance and less C0G or vice-versa, but
be careful to keep the combined capacitance the same
as the original design.
A temperature-controlled oven would be the fastest and
most accurate way to determine the temperature
coefficient, although simply measuring the frequency
every few minutes from a cold start is quite a reasonable
method.
Whatever the actual start-up drift of your particular rig,
make sure it has stabilized prior to going on the air.
Using the RF Attenuator
Certain loud stations may induce what is known as AGC
“popping”. Really loud stations may cause the AGC to
almost completely shut down the receiver for a second
or so until the AGC loop/s have a chance to recover. The
cure for this is simply to turn up the RF attenuation using
the pot on the rear panel.
