Operating Instructions:
Band Selection:
Bands are selected with 2 sets of three-
position slide switches. The three switches 
must be in the same position for the rig to 
work properly.
The band switches on the left select the 40 
and 30 meter bands. When set to the right-
most position, the second set of band 
switches are enabled: 20m, 17m and 15 meter 
bands.
The switches on top row state which band to 
operate.
When a band is changed, a Morse number 
corresponding to that band is annunciated by 
a side tone: 4 for 40m, 3 for 30m, 2 for 20m, 
7 for 17m and 5 for 15m. The last used 
frequency for any band is restored when the 
band is selected.
Display:
A four line, 16 character LCD is used to display radio information.
Line 1: Normal – Operating frequency.
Alternate – Decoded Morse when using a paddle - either transmitting or entering a message.
Line 2: RIT delta frequency
Line 3: Menu selections
Line 4: Normal – Keyer Speed, 24 hour timer, battery voltage.
Alternate – switch functions
Frequency Tuning:
The UP arrow (Tune Up) and DOWN arrow (Tune Down) switches change the operating frequency in 50 Hz steps.
●
Holding the switch closed for longer than 1 second begins a fast-tune mode where the frequency changes in 
100 Hz steps.
●
If the opposite tuning switch is held closed while in fast-tune mode, the step rate will increase to 30 
steps/second for real fast tuning.
The frequency can also be rotary tuned by adding an optional rotary encoder. In this case, the tuning rate is 
fixed at 50 Hz steps, furthermore, the tune up and down switches are still enabled.
RIT:
●
Enter RIT: HOLD RIT closed for 1 second or longer.
●
Exit RIT: HOLD RIT closed for 1 second or longer.
Display: Line 2, [RIT   0.000+]
The plus (+) or minus (-) difference (delta) between the transmit frequency and the current receive frequency is 
shown below the primary frequency readout. The delta frequency is limited to +/- 1.550 kHz.
RIT toggle:
RIT can be toggled on and off to check the transmit frequency for activity.
●
TAP <Fn> switch to toggle RIT.
Display: Line 2,   [RIT   R=T] Frequency tuning is locked out when R=T, however, radio can transmit and use 
message memories.

Morse Frequency Annunciation
This function can be turned ON or OFF in the CONFIG menu. Default is OFF.
●
Tap the <Fn> switch.
●
The current frequency is sounded by the side tone at the current keyer speed.
●
Format: 000.0 kHz “T” is used for zeros, “R” indicates decimal point.
Change Keyer speed: [ADJ K SPEED]
●
HOLD the <Fn> switch for 1 second until the message [ADJ K SPEED] is displayed on Line 3
●
Speed is shown on Line 4 [CSxx] where xx is current CW speed.
●
Use UP/DOWN arrow switches, DOT/DASH paddle or rotary encoder to change speed in 1 WPM steps. Range 9 to 
35 WPM.
●
Tap the <Fn> switch to exit
Straight key Mode:
Straight key mode can be enabled in two ways:
1)
A mono phone plug in the paddle jack on power-up will turn on straight key mode.
2)
TAP the RIT switch while in <Adjust Code Speed> mode. Tapping will toggle straight key mode ON and OFF. 
Straight key mode cannot be turned OFF if a mono plug is in the paddle jack.
●
When Straight key mode is active, the code speed display will change from [CSxx] to [SKxx].
●
The code speed can be changed using the <UP/DOWN> arrow switches or rotary encoder.
●
DFE, Message Memory entry and Tune modes are not available when Straight Key mode is active.
●
Straight key mode is reset on power-up, unless a mono plug is in the paddle jack.
Direct Frequency Entry: [DFE]
DFE mode allows the user to directly enter a new frequency via the paddle.
Display:
Line 1: current frequency…
Line 2:   ---.-
Line 3: DFE
Line 4: EXIT RE   LD {Switch function labels}
●
Enter four Morse digits 0 to 9
●
Short cut: TAP <LD> to reset current frequency to the bottom of the band or to load remaining decades as 
zero “0”
●
TAP <LD> (DOWN Arrow) load the new frequency
●
TAP <RE> (RIT) re-set entry to zero and start again
●
TAP <EXIT> (Fn) exit with no change

Message entry [ENTER MSG]
Line 1 – blanks. Will display decoded Morse characters as entered.
Line 2 – blank
Line 3 – ENTER MSG
Line 4 – EXIT CK RE BS (Switch function labels)
Message count may use up to 63 characters (including word spaces) and there can be three unique posts. Word 
spaces are automatically inserted after a word-space pause of ‘7 dot’ lengths. A “Back Space” switch can be used 
to correct errors or eliminate word spaces. Note: you cannot delete the first character entered. The menu display 
will scroll when the message exceeds 16 characters.
Switch functions:
●
<EXIT> (Fn) TAP to EXIT any time before storing a message.
●
<CK>   (RIT) TAP to check (review) the message and hear how it sounds prior to actually storing the 
message.
●
<RE>   (UP Arrow) TAP to Re-enter (rest) the message entry mode. The only way to clear the first 
character.
●
<BS>   (Down Arrow) TAP to Back Space one location.
Once the Message has been reviewed and after tapping the <CK> switch, Line 4 will change to:
[M1  RE   M2  M3]
●
TAP M1, M2 or M3 to store the message in that memory location.
○
Once tapped, line 4 will change to [STORING]. A Morse "R" will sound when done and message entry mode 
will return for another message, if desired.
○
When done TAP <EXIT> to escape to normal operation.
●
TAP <RE> to escape back to message entry mode without storing.
TUNE [TUNE]
Tune mode allows the user to toggle the transmitter ON and OFF to adjust an antenna tuner with both hands. If the 
operator uses one hand adjusting antenna tuner, sending a string of dots may be faster.
NOTE: If the DC power supply exceeds 10 volts, the output power is reduced by turning the supply to the PA ON and 
OFF at about a 1:3 ratio. This ensures no damage to the PA if excessive SWR is encountered while adjusting the 
antenna tuner for lowest SWR. Since this PWM of the PA supply voltage has no feedback, the output power switches 
low and gradually builds until it stabilizes at about one-third its steady-state output.
●
Tap <DOT> paddle to toggle ON
●
TAP <DASH> paddle to toggle OFF
●
TAP <Fn> switch to exit back to normal operation
SET TIME: [SET TIME]
A 24 hour clock can be enabled and displayed on the bottom line of the LCD. The DFE function is used to enter the 
time via the paddle. The time is not displayed until the set time function is used. The “display time” flag is 
reset on power up if battery back-up is not used.
Display:
Line 1: operating frequency
Line 2: ---.-
Line 3: SET TIME
Line 4: EXIT  RE LD

============================================================

●
Enter the current time + 1 minute (24 hour format) using the paddle: hours, then minutes. Leading zero 
must be entered if the time is before 10:00am.
●
Tap <LD> (DOWN Arrow) to load the time and exit.
●
Tap <RE> to clear and re-enter the time
●
Tap <EXIT> to escape with no action taken.
Configuration: [CONFIG]
Configuration allows the user to turn ON or OFF the Morse frequency annunciation. The display of Morse while 
transmitting and storing of the current frequency for all the bands, plus the current keyer speed to be used as 
the power-on, frequency and code speed is annunciated.
●
TAP <EXIT> (Fn) to escape
●
TAP <ST> (RIT) to store
●
TAP <DM> DOWN arrow) to toggle Display of Morse characters ON and OFF. The side tone will annunciate “ON” 
or “OFF” to indicate the selected state.
●
TAP <MA> (UP arrow) to toggle the Morse audio annunciation ON and OFF. The side tone will annunciate “ON” 
or “OFF to indicate the selected state.
Sending a previously stored message:
●
TAP <RIT>
●
Then TAP <Fn> (message 1), <DWN Arrow> (message 2) or <UP Arrow> (message 3) within one-half second of 
tapping <RIT>
If a message has not been stored in a selected location, no message will be sent.
Pause, terminate and Beacon Mode:
Once a message has begun, it may be paused, terminated or set to repeat (beacon mode).
●
HOLD <DASH> to pause a message. The message will pause at the first word space after the paddle is 
closed.
●
HOLD <DOT> to terminate the message. The message will terminate at the first word space after the paddle 
is closed and normal operation restored when the paddle is released.
Beacon (repeat) mode:
After a message is in progress, the message may be set to repeat by HOLDING the respective switch for that memory 
location closed until a word space is detected. For example, if Message 1 was started, hold the <Fn> switch 
closed, if Message 2, <Down arrow> and if Message 3, <Up arrow>.
Line 3 will read: [BEACON  3] Where {3} is the repeat delay in seconds.
●
During a word space, the delay can be set up to 9 seconds using the up and down arrow switches or rotary 
encoder.
The message may be paused or terminated using the DOT or Dash method. The message must first be terminated 
before transmitting will begin again.
Battery Backup:
A 12 mm, 3V lithium coil cell is used to power the processor when power is removed from the transceiver. When the 
processor detects the input voltage below 4.5 V, the processor is in sleep mode, but the 32.768 kHz clock and 
timer remains active to keep the RTC running. In this mode, current from the coin cell is a mere 10 uA. All the 
current operating settings are retained in RAM thus the rig returns to the same state on power up as it was when 
power was turned off. If the rig is to be stored for a long period of time, it would be a good idea to disconnect 
the battery by slipping a small piece of paper between the top contact and battery.
MTR-5B Page -5-
To access the battery: Turn off power. Remove the two side panel screws and the knurled nuts 
securing the "paddle" and "phones" jacks. Carefully separate the "bottom" of the case to expose the 
battery holder.

Assembly:
●
The work area should be reasonably clean and uncluttered. Good lighting is a must.
●
Empty the packets containing the parts into a small bowl for this will ensure the parts will not be lost. 
Some builders like to assembly over a cookie sheet as the lip around the edge helps to keep parts from 
going far. The metal sheet also provides some measure of static control, especially if the sheet is 
grounded. A white sheet under the work area could help in finding stray parts which might wander away.
●
Very thin (0.015”) solder is supplied for soldering the surface mount parts where very little solder is 
needed for each connection. Ideally, a convex fillet at the end of chip resistors and capacitors is 
desired. Try not to finish with a solder ball at the end of the part.
●
Do not use liquid solder flux. It simply creates a mess and is difficult to clean off the board and from 
under parts. If not completely removed from the board, it can cause problems.
●
Before placing a part onto the board, lightly tin one pad for where the part will be placed. Assembly 
time may be increased by first tinning one pad at all the locations for which a particular part will be 
placed. There is no need for a low wattage soldering iron. It is best to have a hot tip which will get 
the job done quickly.  A small tip on the iron perhaps 1/32” to 1/16” chisel or round point is best.
●
Most of the surface mount parts come in part carriers. To remove the part(s), hold the carrier close 
to the work surface and carefully peel back the clear plastic covering. This can be done with the tip 
of a sharp hobby knife such as an #11 Xacto blade or pointy tipped tweezers. Once the clear plastic 
strip is removed, lay out the part onto your work surface.
●
If tweezers are used, be careful not to grab onto the part too tightly. Surface mount parts have a 
way of flying out from between the tips of the tweezers--never to be seen again. Be careful!
●
An alternative to using tweezers for small parts is to use a tooth pick or ‘chop stick’ with the end 
rubbed onto a little bees wax. The bees wax makes the end tacky enough for the part will adhere to 
it. For smaller ICs, clutch the part length wise with the tweezers.
●
Tack one end of a part in its place by applying heat to the end of the part over the tinned circuit 
board pad, while applying little pressure to be sure it lays flat on the PC board. Be sure to heat 
both the pad and the end of the part. Generally, additional solder is not needed for this connection. 
Secondly, solder the other end of the part. If both ends are not soldered at this time, there is a 
blameless chance the builder will forget to return and solder all the parts which require it.
●
It is nearly impossible not to make solder shorts between pins on the DDS and processor chip due to 
the close pin spacing. Remove any shorts with solder wick.
Using solder paste:
Using solder paste is the ideal way to build the board. Small amounts of solder paste in an application syringe 
can be purchased for about five dollars from ‘Cash Olson’ on the internet. Also needed is a warming plate to 
preheat the board to about 250 degrees F and a low power heat gun. An “Embossing” heat gun is commonly used 
(found at craft stores). A soft air flow is required as to not to blow parts off the board. A typical hot air gun 
is too high-powered with air and heat.
For chip, caps and resistors, a very small dab of solder paste is placed on the pads and then the part 
placed onto the pads. The SMT parts will slide around very easily, so one must be careful not to nudge them from 
their correct location. For ICs, placing the IC down first and then engaging a bead of paste along the leads 
appears to be a better method than placing the paste on the pads first followed by the IC.
The LCD display should be hand soldered, along with all the through-hole parts. Begin with the side of the board 
with the most parts first, which in this case, is the bottom for the MTR.
Once all the parts have been placed, place the board on the warming plate and heat to about 250 degrees 
F. Slowly heat the top of the board with a hot air gun. When the solder paste reaches its melting point, the 
solder will liquefy and the parts snap into alignment on the pad. Here is where the solder paste turns color from 
a dull gray to shinny brown. Be aware of “tomb stoning,” which is when an SMT chip capacitor or resistor will 
stand on one end making no connection. Once all the solder has reflowed, remove power from the heating plate and 
let MTR cool down slowly.
A “YouTube” video showing how to solder SMT parts, both by hand and using solder paste is: 
http://youtu.be/Ah5HEjDTHUo. The builder may want to view other suggested videos on SMT soldering which are done 
a bit more professionally. Work slowly and be patient!

Using the parts placement guides:
The parts placement guides on the following pages are color coded to show the location of the various types of 
parts. Parts to be installed are highlighted in various colors to help identify their locations. The guides are 
scaled so that the writing on them is easy to see on a computer monitor and come out crisper after the conversion 
to pdf. Unfortunately, if you print all these pages out, it will use up a bunch of your ink jet ink.  
Some parts do not have values marked on them or are very hard to read. Capacitors are not marked so these have 
been color coded with a marker on the part carrier using the resistor color code to indicate their value in pfd.
SOT-23 parts have numbers printed on them, but are very hard to read. Therefore, these parts are also color 
coded, but with a color sticker, as they come in plastic carriers.  The color on the carrier matches the color 
shown on the placement guide diagram.
 
Resistors have their value printed on them, though it might take a magnifying glass to read the numbers. 
Therefore, individual values are not color coded.
Due to the tight spacing of 
parts, not all of them have 
their designation number 
printed next to them on the 
board. These two diagrams show 
the part number designation 
for each part location.

Semiconductor placement
●
Finding Pin 1.  Some of the ICs used in this kit have a dot or indentation 
at Pin 1 corner of the chip. For others, the Pin 1 locations isn't as 
obvious. The manufactures logo is sometimes used (as is the case for U1 
and U3) or sometimes there is a line along the Pin 1 end of the chip. In 
all cases, there is a beveled or rounded edge along the side of the Pin 1 
(left) side of the IC package. When the package is orientated vertically 
and the beveled edge is to the left, Pin 1 is always in the upper left 
corner as shown in the diagram.  
●
U3 and U7, (SA612) use the manufactures log (NXP) for the pin 1 corner designator.
●
Before placing an IC or transistor, tin one corner pad and then tack that lead of the part down first. 
Before soldering any other pins, make sure all the leads are lined up on the pads. This is especially 
important for U8 and U10, where these isn't much room for error. (See hint below to line up the leads 
with the pads.) Solder the lead of the opposite corner from the tacked lead to be sure the body doesn't 
move when you finish solder the rest of the leads.
●
You will have to carefully check the number on the 8 pin ICs to tell them apart. Using a magnifying glass 
and tilting the part slightly to the light will aid in reading a part number. The rest of the ICs are in 
unique packages and are easier to determine their locations.
●
Tilting an IC to the light can make reading the part number easier.
●
U1 and U6 part carriers are color coded to make it easier to tell them apart.
●
There are several different SOT-23 devices. The packages they are in are each color coded to match the 
layout diagram.
●
D1, D2, D3, and D7 have a very faint line on one end to indicate the cathode end. Look carefully for this 
line and face it towards the line printed on the board.
●
There may be more numbers or letters on the semiconductor packages then indicated on the layout diagram. 
These numbers/letters are date or lot codes and can vary depending on when the parts were purchased. 
Therefore, these are not used for part identification on the layout diagrams.
●
HINT: Taping a straight edge, such as a thin metal ruler, across the board and lined up with the bottom 
outline of U8 or U9 (as the case maybe) will aid in keeping the part aligned with the pads. Do U8 first 
followed by U9. After soldering the leads, clean up any solder shorts with the supplied solder wick. Be 
sure to only pull the wick parallel to the leads and not against the grain!

First mount U8 (AD9834) followed by U9 (430G2433). Use the straight edge hint on page 12 to line up the 
pins on the pads.
●
Soldering U11, the 60 MHz clock, will be a little tricky since there is not much of a lead sticking out 
the side of the part. Tin all four corner pads and the ground pad in the center to put a little solder 
bump on them. As the lettering on the part is hard to read, make sure you have it orientated properly, 
then hold the part in place with a little downward pressure while heating each corner pin in turn. Flip 
the board over and heat the ground pad up, flowing a little solder into the hole. It's not overly 
important if this isn't soldered.
●
The pin 1 dot and lettering on U5 is also not very easy to read. You'll have to be extra careful to get 
this orientated properly. Note that when properly installed, the lettering on the part will be “upside 
down,” i.e. facing the top edge of the board.  
●
The cathode line printed on the D1, D2, and D7 diodes is also hard to grasp.
●
D8 should be easy to identify as it is the only two legged part of its size, and somewhat larger than the 
D1 type diodes.
●
Color coding is used on the part carriers for D4, D5, D6, Q2 and U6 to make it easier to identify.
●
Pin 1 of the remaining ICs should be easy to identify as they all have an obvious dot in the upper left 
corner. The exception is U3 and U7. On these parts, look for “NXP” printed in the upper left corner.
●
Use the supplied solder wick to remove any solder bridges between pins on the ICs. It is nearly 
impossible not to make shorts when soldering the processor (U9) and the DDS chip (U8), whether if it is 
done with solder paste or hand soldering. The pins on the SO-23-5 parts are also prone to shorts.
You will have a few left over semiconductors. The PTC fuse (used later) is also in the semiconductor bag. Put 
these in a safe place to use later.

Resistors:
Resistors used in more than one location are shown color coded on the diagram to make it easier to find where 
they are placed. The parts themselves are not color coded.
Be careful not to mix up R18 and R19 since they differ only by the last digit. By the same token 222 and 223 
along with 103 and 104 value could be easy to mix up too, so read the numbers carefully.
Inductors:
The inductors are in a clear plastic carrier and marked with a single color representing the first digit in its 
value. 10 uHy = brown, 8.2 = gray, 4.7 = yellow, 3.3 = green.
You will have a few left over resistors and one 10 uHy inductor which will go on the top side of the board. Be 
sure to put these in a safe place for later use.
●
If planning adding the 80M band and eliminating one of the standard bands, you will need to place L12 to 
L3 and R4 to R6 values one position to the left. This assumes the operator will be eliminating 15 meters. 
If desiring to eliminate one of the other bands, the same approach applies.

Capacitors:
The paper strips holding the chip caps are color coded to identify their value. The color coding is the same as 
used for through-hole resistors but instead of ohms it represents picofarads. Therefore, a .01 ufd cap (10,000 
pfd) is color coded Brown/Black/Orange. Values of less than 100 pfd are coded with just the two digit colors. 22 
pfd is Red/Red.
The placement diagram highlights the color of the multiplier to help you locate where a particular value is 
placed on the board. Values less than 100 pfd have their numerical value colored to match that on the carrier.
Because of their height, the two aluminum electrolytic caps will be installed later with the through-hole parts. 
Otherwise the board will not sit flat when you install the top side parts.
You will have a few caps left over to be used on the top side of the board. Be sure to put these in a safe place 
for later.  
That completes the bottom side SMT components. On to the top side!

Top side SMT components:
Since there aren't many SMT parts on top side, only one diagram will be used for all of them.
Notes:
L7: L7 is a power inductor which is a little tricky to solder in place due to the minimal solder tabs sticking 
out the bottom. Tin the pads on the board so you have a little bump of solder. Place the part over the pads and 
heat up the bottom edge of the inductor with your iron, adding a little bit of solder to help the transfer heat; 
then do the other side. Use an ohm meter to verify the solder connections.
Inasmuch most of the colors were used identifying the caps, all the resistors are highlighted in the same color.
Most of the caps in the output filter use 1206 size parts and are on a clear plastic carrier. These parts are 
identified with a single color equal to its most significant digit. With the exception of the 150 pfd caps, which 
use Brown/Green, the 560 pfd cap uses green and the 100 pfd cap uses brown.
Trimmer caps: Be sure to match the notched end of the cap with the notched end of the board outline. This ensures 
the adjustment screw is grounded and will not be affected when using a metal screw driver to adjust it.
F1 is a resettable fuse. It is different than the other 1206 sized cap parts, as it has a green body with notches 
on the ends and has the numbers “101” printed on it. This part was found in the semiconductor parts bag.

Through-hole components:
●
Install the bottom side through-hole parts first, with the exception of the battery holder since the 
holder sits above the pads for the push button TACK switches.
●
Depending on the type of enclosure the board in mounted, the builder may elect not to install the two 
phone jacks onto the board. It may be more convenient to panel mount the jacks and use jumpers to wire 
them to the board.
●
The toroids will be wound and installed later.
Top side:
●
X6: once soldered, clip the leads flush 
with the board on the top side as the 
display will sit on top of these 
connections. Tack solder the end of the 
crystal to the solder pad to hold it in 
place.
●
C5: 33 ufd/6.3V Note the negative end is 
the side with the black “half-moon.”
●
C82: 100 ufd/16V
●
Q4/5/6 – BS170 TO-92
Bottom side:
●
X1-5: sit flat to board.
●
X1: Tack solder end of case to solder pad 
to ground.
●
X2-5: use lead clipping to ground case to 
solder pads directly below the case. Tack 
solder wire to the top edge of the can.
●
S5: DPDT slide switch.
●
When installing the slide switches, 
solder just one pin and then double check 
to make sure switch is sitting flat and 
square to the board. If the switch is 
cocked and more than one pin is soldered, 
straightening it again will not be easy.
●
S6 to S11: 3PDT slide switches
●
LCD: Getting all the pins to line up with 
the holes can take a little prodding.
○
Make sure the display sits flat and 
snug to the board.
○
Make sure there are no shorts between 
the pads when soldered since the pads 
are very closely spaced.
●
S1-4: TACK PB switches. The spacing on the leads will only line up properly one way.
●
Battery holder: Now that the PB switches have been installed, mount the battery holder. I made a mistake 
and called out the mounting holes to be VIAs instead of solder pads so they came covered with solder 
mask. The solder mask has been scraped off around the hole for you so there is a better chance of making 
a good connection.
○
Subsequently, there isn't much space between the switches soldered to the battery terminal pins. Be 
very, very careful not to touch the switches and melt them!!! Check the positive terminal with an ohm 
meter to make sure it's not shorted to ground.
Go to next page for toroid winding data.
MTR-5B Page -17-

============================================================
PAGE 18
============================================================

Toroid winding data:
●
Wind the wire snug to the core. A sloppy and loose winding will result in poor power output and an 
increase in spurious emissions.
●
After winding, arrange the wire so that the turns are as evenly spaced as possible.
●
The magnet wire can be tinned with the soldering iron by melting through the insulation, but this must be 
done before the wire is placed onto the pad. Tin the wire up to the core to avoid wire insulation in the 
hole after the core has been snugged onto to the board.
●
L16: 8 turns (~6”) on black FT-37-43 core, mount on top side of board.
●
80M option: On the 80 meter inclusion, the band sequence will start with 80m in the L17/L18 positions and 
all the other bands will move over one slot. Typically when adding 80m, 15m will be deleted but any other 
band can be eliminated instead. Just keep the left to right sequence of increasing frequency scheme. This 
will of course also apply to the receiver input filters and band select resistors which will have to be 
repositioned accordingly. NOTE: parts for 80 meter filters are not included and must be obtained by the 
builder from a parts distributer.

Fix a defect on board:
An open VIA was discovered which needs to be fixed with a short piece of magnet wire. Use the least amount of 
exposed tinned lead as possible to make the connections. This fix connects the output side of the 40 meter 
receiver band pass filter to the selector switch. This may not be a problem on all boards, thus check for 
continuity with an ohm meter to find if it's needed before adding the jumper.
Inspect your work!
Now that the board is complete, it's time to review it very carefully looking for bad or missing solder 
connections or shorts between leads on the ICs. Use a magnifying glass and inspect the connections on all the 
parts. Removing flux residue can make inspecting the connections easier. “Electrical parts cleaner” which can be 
found in the automotive section of Walmart works well for removing flux. Soldering issues are the number one 
reason a kit does not work and catching them now will save much time and effort (and possible damage) later.  
Power Jack and Antenna jack wiring:
The power jack will need to wired to 
the board before the board can be 
tested. The wiring of the BNC antenna 
jack can be put off for now, as it 
will just get in the way until you 
need to align the receiver front end 
and test the transmitter.
Once the power jack has been wired, 
wrap the exposed connections on the 
jack with electrical tape so there is 
no possibility of then shorting out 
to something on the board while you 
move it around.
Adding a rotary tuning encoder:
 The encoder is wired to the three 
pads to the right of the display 
viewed from the top of the board and 
to the left of U9 from the bottom, 
where the pads are labeled.
Any mechanical or optical encoder 
with Quadrature outputs can be used. 
There are many to choose from. A 
suitable panel mount encoder would be 
Mouser part # 652-PEC11R-4220F-S12. 
This encoder also has a push switch 
built in which the builder might 
elect to wire to the Fn switch.

Alignment:
●
Use a 9 volt transistor radio battery to power up the board for the first time. If there are any 
problems, the 9V radio battery can't deliver enough current to do any serious damage.
●
Power up the board and the display should come on. Everything should be functional but the BFO trimmer 
needs to be set. 
●
The BFO can be adjusted by ear with off air signals, but it is best done using the BFO ADJUST mode. This 
allows you to set the BFO trimmer so that the beat note is peaked in the audio band pass filter. 
●
The reference oscillator frequency constant used for frequency calculations can be adjusted to match the 
actual frequency of the oscillator. An accurate frequency counter is required for this adjustment. 
●
The Local Oscillator frequency can be tweaked so it is centered better in the pass band of the IF crystal 
filter. It should be pretty close to center by default, but the exact center frequency can vary by a few 
100 Hz due to the sorting of the crystals which matches them to 10 Hz.This adjustment is best done with 
the aid of an Oscilloscope. If you don't have one, it can be done with a sound card running an 
Oscilloscope or PSK program.
Reference oscillator adjustment:
If you do not have an accurate frequency counter, advance directly to BFO adjust mode by pushing the <Fn> switch.
●
Enter calibration mode by powering up the board with both the <Fn> and <RIT> switches held closed.
●
The display will read “CAL REF” on the lower line. 
●
Connect an accurate frequency counter to TP1 (located the left of the display and just below R32) 
●
Use the tune up or tune down switches to set the frequency to exactly 10.000,000 MHz. 
●
When done, push the <Fn> switch to advance to the BFO adjustment mode. 
BFO Adjustment:
●
Connect an Oscilloscope at test point 3 (TP3, just below headphone jack) or plug in a set of headphones.
●
While simultaneously holding closed the <Fn> and <RIT> switches, turn the power on. 
●
The display will read [BFO ADJUST] 
●
Adjust the BFO trimmer cap to peak the signal, which should occur at about 600 Hz.  
L.O. Adjustment:
●
Skip this if no scope and are peaking by ear.
●
Connect the oscilloscope to TP2.
●
Use the Up and Down tuning buttons to find where the signal starts to roll off, then return to where it 
is centered in the pass band of the filter. This might be a little hard to see due to the noise on the 
signal from the switching supply ripple.
●
Once center of the IF filter pass band is determined, return to TP3 and readjust the BFO trimmer to peak 
the signal in the audio band pass filter again.
Complete the BFO alignment:
●
Tap the <Fn> switch to exit and store the data. The display will blank for a second and then the board 
will rest and normal operation will begin.
Entering BFO adjustment mode later:
●
Remove the backup battery. 
●
Turn on power while holding closed both the <Fn> and <RIT> switches. 
●
This will reload the default values and clear the band frequency memory locations. 
●
The BFO tone and LO centering can now be changed as previously described.
●
TAP <Fn> to store and exit.

============================================================

Receiver input tuning and transmitter testing:
While peaking the receiver input by ear and using off air signals, the receiver inputs are best peaked by using a 
signal generator and oscilloscope. If neither are available, use another transmitter for the signal generator and 
a PC sound card Oscilloscope or PSK program.
Receiver peaking:
●
Set the signal source
●
The trimmers are labeled 80 to 17, but should have been labeled 40 to 15.
●
Preset the trimmer caps by turning them about one-quarter turn.
●
Apply the signal to the antenna jack, tune in the signal and peak the trimmers for best audio amplitude 
as seen on the 'Scope or as heard by ear.   
●
Once the initial peak has been determined, reduce the amplitude of the input signal to keep the audio amp 
from being limited by the clipping diodes.
●
Work back and forth between the two trimmers to get the best peak as the two are somewhat interactive.
●
Advance to the next band.
Transmitter testing:
●
Connect the MTR-5B antenna jack to a suitable power meter and dummy load.
●
If possible, use a regulated power supply for best results, 9.0 or 12.0 volts.
●
Set the rig to ‘Straight’ key mode.
●
Select the 40 meter band.
●
Key the transmitter and note the power output.
●
Power output should be about 2.5 watts with a 9V supply and about 4.5 watts with a 12V supply.
●
Advance to the next band and test. Repeat for next band.
●
Power output is sensitive to inductance of the input side transmitter low pass filter, L17, L19, L21, L23 
and L25. The variations are primarily due to how tight the wire is wound on the toroid core and the wire 
spacing around the core. There can also be variations in the permeability of the cores.
●
If power output is significantly higher than it should be, move some turns closer together. If power 
output is somewhat lower than it should be, space the turns as much as possible.  
Battery Backup:
Once all the adjustments are made and the board is working properly, now install the lithium coin cell backup 
battery.
●
Turn the rig on.
●
Install the CR1225 battery into the socket, plus (+) side up.
Troubleshooting:
With very, very few exceptions, any trouble getting the board to work will be tracked down to soldering issues. 
By now all solder “bugs” should have been found and fixed on the first inspection, but some can be missed. 
Shotgun approaches to fixing soldering problems by re-soldering everything should be avoided. There is a good 
chance most of the circuits are working properly. The trick is to narrow down the problem to a specific area by 
figuring out what does work. No transmit or receive is often the soldering to the DDS reference clock chip which 
is a bit tricky to solder in place.
MTR-5B Page -21-

============================================================

Packaging the board:
The diagram below can be used as a drill template, but before using--it confirm that it printed to actual size 
using a ruler and checking the dimensions of the red board outline.
An “off the shelf” enclosure could be used, or you can make one yourself. One option is to make the front panel 
and back side from a sheet of aluminum and the rest of the box made out of thin wood. Check eBay for sources of 
0.032” aluminum sheets. While the 3.5mm stereo jacks can be PC-board mounted, they can also be panel mounted 
which increases the number of options of enclosures to choose, especially if a plastic box is used.
Making the rectangular holes for the slide switches is a bit of a pain. In metal, one first needs to drill a hole 
at the center of the outline and then use small files to produce the final rectangular shape. Another option is 
to drill an oversized round hole and make a thin plastic overlay to cover the panel and hide all the sins.
Cutting the large rectangular hole for the display is most easily done with a Dremal drilling tool with a cutting 
wheel.  Be careful and wear a dust mask and eye protection. One can drill a small hole in each of the four 
corners first so as not to cut beyond the edges. The other option is simply to drill a row of small holes along 
the edge of the cut out and then use a file to clean it up to the final size.
  
Mounting hardware is included in the form of four 3/16 #2 threaded spacers, 1/2” #2 screws and nuts. These are 
used to mount the board under the front panel and provide the proper spacing. A clear plastic window should be 
placed between the panel and the display to protect it. A piece of clear film is supplied for this purpose. The 
easiest way to secure it to the panel is to cover it with some clear shipping tape, while trying not to trap air 
bubbles under it.
