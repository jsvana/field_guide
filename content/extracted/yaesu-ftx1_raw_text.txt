General Description
The FTX-1 can be used in a variety of ways, from field operation using batteries to mobile opera-
tion.
FTX-1 Field
The included high-capacity lithium-ion battery “SBR-52LI” can be mounted on the back, allow-
ing for long-term field operation of approximately 9 hours on the HF ​band in SSB with trans-
mission output of 6W (5W in QRP mode).
When connected to an external power source (DC 13.8V), operating with a transmission out-
put of 10W is possible.
The battery and antenna tuner “FC-80” (optional) can be installed at the same time, so anten-
na tuning can be performed even in field operation.
When performing continuous transmission such as data communication using an external 
power source, the cooling fan “SCF-1” (optional) can be attached to efficiently cool the heat 
generated by the radio.
FTX-1 optima
High power output of 100W*
1 allows for full-scale fixed station operation.
The panel can be removed from the main unit and attached to a commercially available stand, 
etc., to operate at your preferred angle.
*1: 50W for 144MHz and 430MHz bands
Full coverage of HF to UHF bands in all modes
Full coverage of amateur radio bands from 1.8 to 430MHz in all modes (SSB/CW/AM/FM/C4FM 
digital). General coverage reception from 30kHz to 174MHz and 400 to 470MHz is possible.
Supports simultaneous reception of two bands* and simultaneous C4FM/
C4FM digital playback
Supports simultaneous reception of two bands*. It can be used in a variety of ways, such as enjoy-
ing DX in SSB mode on HF while monitoring local club stations in C4FM digital on V/U.
* Simultaneous reception of HF/HF is not supported.
High-brightness TFT full-color display with touch-panel functionality
The FTX-1 is equipped with a 4.3-inch full-color TFT display. Operating functions, including the re-
ceiving band noise and signal interference reduction tools, are graphically displayed. Even while in-
volved in rigorous operations, such as DXpeditions and contests, the operator may instantly grasp 
the status of each function.
Filter Function Display monitors the status of the passband
In the display, a filter function display presents the state of the pass-band. In addition to the operat-
ing state of the interference removal functions, the filter function information is displayed. Not only 
can you grasp the operating status of WIDTH, SHIFT, NOTCH and CONTOUR at a glance, you can 
also view the status of the RF spectrum in the passband.
3DSS method adopted
In addition to the conventional waterfall display, a 3DSS (3 Dimensions Spectrum Stream) image 
method has been adopted. The 3DSS image uses the horizontal axis (X axis) for frequency, the 
vertical axis (Y axis) for signal intensity, and the Z axis for time. Compared to the conventional wa-
terfall method, the signal strength is displayed in three dimensions as well as in color, recognition of 
changes in the band conditions is instant, convenient and intuitive.

============================================================
PAGE 5
============================================================

Two selectable RF Stages amplify the desired signals from low band to 
high band
RF amplifier AMP1, and AMP2 are low noise negative feedback RF amplifiers that may be selected 
or combined in series as is needed for various low-band, high-band, frequency and noise condi-
tions.  In addition, the IPO (Intercept Point Optimization) function maximizes the dynamic range and 
enhances the close multi-signal and inter-modulation characteristics of the receiver. The influence 
of strong broadcasting stations, especially in the low bands, can be minimized.
Monitor 5 channels in the VHF/UHF band and operate efficiently using
PMG (Primary Memory Group)
The PMG function scans up to 5 channels registered to the PMG. The receive status of each chan-
nel is simultaneously displayed in real time with a bar graph.
* Frequencies between 108MHz and 470MHz can be registered.
Super-DX
The Super DX function increases the sensitivity of the RF amplifier when the received signal is 
weak, expanding the calling range.
MAG (Memory Channel Band Auto Grouping)
The memory channels are automatically categorized in each band, so that memory channels can 
be easily and quickly recalled.
High quality sound and loud volume from 2-way front speakers
Equipped with two speakers of different diameters, the sound is emitted from the opening at the 
bottom of the front panel, reproducing high quality sound at a volume sufficient for field operation.
The FTX-1 optima has a large 66mm, 2.5W high quality speaker on top of the rear case, ensuring 
sufficient volume for fixed station operation.
QRP mode allows you to set the maximum transmission output to 5W
Equipped with a QRP mode that allows you to set the maximum transmission output to “5W” on all 
bands. This is useful for QRP contests.
About TFT Displays
FTX-1 series utilizes a TFT liquid-crystal display.
Although TFT liquid-crystal displays are made using very precise technology, they are prone 
to develop dead pixels (dark dot) or pixels that are always on (bright dot). Please under-
stand that such phenomena do not constitute product defects or malfunctions. Rather, this 
phenomenon occurs due to limitations in the manufacturing technology with respect to TFT 
liquid-crystal displays.
Depending on the viewing angle, unevenness in color or brightness may occur. Please note 
that any unevenness observed is inherent to the construction of TFT liquid crystal displays 
and therefore does not constitute a product defect or malfunction.
If your TFT liquid-crystal display becomes dirty, please use a dry soft cloth or tissue to wipe 
the display clean. If it is extremely dirty, moisten it with water or lukewarm water and wipe it 
off with a soft cloth that has been wrung out tightly. Use of glass cleaner, household cleaners, 
organic solvents, alcohol, abrasives, and/or like substance may damage the TFT liquid-crys-
tal display.

Important Receiver Settings
The status of various operations that are important during receive, are shown at the bottom of the 
display. To change a setting, touch the appropriate location on the display.
Important setting items when receiving
•	ATT (Attenuator)
Displays the current ATT (Amount of receive 
input signal attenuation).
When the desired signal is extremely strong or 
the noise level is high on a low frequency band, 
activate the attenuator to reduce the incoming 
signal or noise from the antenna.
After touching [ATT], touch the ON or OFF.
•	The ATT feature is only available in the 
HF - 50MHz band.
•	The ATT is set independently for each 
operation band.
•	IPO
The IPO (Intercept Point Optimization) function 
can establish the gain of the RF amplifier sec-
tion to accommodate the connected antenna 
and the received signal conditions. IPO can be 
selected from three operating conditions.
AMP1:	One stage RF amplifier is connected.
This is a well-balanced operation of 
receiver sensitivity and characteristics 
(Approximately 10 dB gain).
AMP2:	Two RF amplifiers are connected in 
series to give top priority to sensitivity 
(Approximately 20 dB gain).
IPO:	
The received signal is input to the IF 
mixer without passing through the RF 
amplifier. This can greatly improve 
receiving, especially in the harsh low 
band signal environment.
After touching [IPO], touch the desired operat-
ing condition.
•	The IPO feature is only available in the 
HF - 50MHz band.
•	IPO is set independently for each oper-
ation band.
•	AMP
Increases the sensitivity of the RF amplifier 
when the received signal is weak.
After touching [AMP], touch the ON or OFF.
The AMP feature is only available in the 
AIR band, 144MHz and 430MHz band.
•	DNF (Digital NOTCH Filter)
The Digital NOTCH Filter (DNF) is an effective 
beat-canceling filter that can null out a number 
of interfering beat notes inside the receiver 
passband.
Because this is an Auto-Notch feature, there is 
no djustment knob associated with this filter.
•	AGC (Automatic Gain Control)
Displays the currently selected AGC setting.
The AGC system is designed to help compen-
sate for fading and other propagation effects. 
The AGC characteristics can be individually set 
for each operating mode. The basic objective 
of AGC is to maintain a constant audio output 
level once a certain minimum threshold of sig-
nal strength is achieved.
After touching [AGC], touch the desired time 
constant.
● AGC can be set for each operation band.
● The “AUTO” selection mode selects the opti-
mum receiver-recovery time for the reception 
mode.

Scope Display Setting
In addition to the conventional two-dimensional waterfall spectrum display, Yaesu has added the 
3-Dimension Spectrum Stream (3DSS) color display. The constantly changing band conditions and 
signals are depicted in real time and color. The frequency span is shown on the horizontal X axis, 
the vertical Y axis depicts the signals and their strengths, and the time is represented on the reced-
ing Z axis. The FTX-1 operator can intuitively grasp the band and signal conditions at any instant.
•	CENTER/CURSOR/FIX
Switches the Spectrum Scope operation each time the key is touched.
•	When the display area is touched, the 
receive frequency is moved to that point.
•	In CENTER mode, the frequency 
touched becomes the center.
•	In CURSOR and FIX mode, the marker 
and the receive frequency move to the 
touched position.
•	CENTER
The receive frequency is always shown at the 
center of the screen and spectrum display. The 
band spectrum is shown within the range set 
by “SPAN”. The CENTER mode is convenient 
for monitoring the signal activity around the op-
erating frequency.

PMG (Primary Memory Group) for VHF/UHF
The PMG function scans up to 5 channels registered to the PMG. The receive status of each chan-
nel is simultaneously displayed in real time with a bar graph. In addition, two channels with signals 
are simultaneously received, allowing convenient standby.
Operation differs between “Manual mode” and “Auto mode”.
In manual mode, transmit and receive are performed on the selected channel. If a signal is received 
on another channel, it can be received at the same time.
In auto mode, when a signal is received on a scanned channel, the radio automatically switches to 
the channel with the signal for transmit and receive.
If a signal is received on another channel, it can be received at the same time.
To register the currently displayed VFO or memory channel to the PMG, simply press and hold the 
key on the frequency.
The PMG feature is only available in the AIR band, 144MHz and 430MHz band.

DSP interference removal functions
Press and hold the [MAIN
] or [SUB
] knob, then rotate the [MAIN
] or 
[SUB
] knob to exchanges the SHIFT, 
WIDTH, NOTCH, CONTOUR and APF.
The “MAIN” side is set with the 
[MAIN
] knob, and the “SUB” side is 
set with the [SUB
] knob.
1. SHIFT
IF SHIFT permits moving the Digital filter pass-
band higher or lower, without changing the 
pitch of the incoming signal, and thus reduce 
or eliminate interference. Because the tuned 
carrier frequency is not varied, there is no need 
to re-tune the operating frequency to eliminate 
the interference.
The total passband tuning range for the IF 
SHIFT system is ±1.2kHz.
2. WIDTH
The IF WIDTH tuning system allows you to 
vary the width of the DSP IF passband, to re-
duce or eliminate interference.
Moreover, the bandwidth may actually be 
expanded from its default setting, should you 
wish to enhance incoming signal fidelity when 
interference on the band is low.
3. NOTCH
The IF NOTCH filter is a highly effective system 
that allows removing an interfering beat note 
or other carrier signal from within the receiver 
passband.
4. CONTOUR
The CONTOUR filter system provides a gen-
tle perturbation of the IF filter passband. The 
CONTOUR is set to either suppress, or boost 
specific frequency components, and thus en-
hances the sound and readability of a received 
signal
5. APF
During CW operation, when interference or 
noise is present, the center frequency is auto-
matically set to the PITCH frequency, making it 
easier to hear the desired signal
●Setting method

Voice Communications (SSB and AM)
When transmitting in SSB or AM mode The FTX-1 transmit audio circuit can be set to the optimum 
operating level by individually adjusting the input and output gains of the microphone amplifier.
The AMC (Automatic Microphone Gain Control) regulates the microphone audio so that dis-
tortion does not occur, even if excessive audio is input.
1. Adjust Microphone gain
Touch the Meter Display and then touch “ALC” 
to select the ALC Meter.
1.	 Press and hold the [FUNC] knob.
2.	 Touch [MIC GAIN].
3.	 Key TX and adjust the [FUNC] knob to set 
the input level of the Microphone Amplifier 
to the position where the ALC Meter needle 
does not exceed the ALC zone on the audio 
peaks.
2. Adjust the AMC gain
Touch the Meter Display and then touch 
“COMP” to select the COMP Meter.
1.	 Press and hold the [FUNC] knob.
2.	 Touch [AMC LEVEL].
3.	 Activate the transmit and speak into the mi-
crophone while adjusting the AMC level with 
the [FUNC] knob.
Adjust the AMC to a point where the COMP 
Meter deflection does not exceed “10dB” on 
the audio peaks.
Setup is completed.
The AMC function only works in LSB, 
USB, AM, AM-N, DATA-L, DATA-U and 
PSK modes.
It does not work in other modes.

Speech Processor
The FTX-1 Speech Processor is designed to 
increase “talk power” by increasing the average 
power output of the transmitted SSB signal.
The speech processor function only 
works in LSB/USB mode. It does not 
work in other modes.
1.	 Adjust the MIC gain as described on the 
previous page.
2.	 Press and hold the [FUNC] knob.
3.	 Touch [PROC LEVEL].
4.	 Touch the Meter area on the display to se-
lect the “COMP” meter.
5.	 The transmit meter becomes the “COMP” 
meter.
6.	 Press the PTT switch on the microphone, 
and speak into the microphone in a normal 
voice level.
7.	 Adjust the [FUNC] knob to set the compres-
sion level within 10 dB.

tor level.
Transmit audio monitor is not activate in 
the FM, FM-N, DATA-FM, D-FM-N, AM 
and AM-N modes.
● If you are using the speaker for monitor-
ing, instead of headphones, excessive 
advancement of the Monitor level can 
cause feedback to occur. Additionally, this 
feedback can cause the VOX system to 
hang up in a loop, making it impossible 
to return to receive. Therefore, we rec-
ommend the use of headphones, if at all 
possible, or the minimum usable setting 
of the Monitor level, if the speaker must 
be used.
4.	 To cancel the monitor function, turn the 
[FUNC] knob to set “MONI LEVEL” to “OFF”.

CLAR (Clarifier)
The clarifier is used to adjust the transceiver 
receive frequency to match the other station 
transmit frequency and improve the audio; or to 
shift the transmit frequency of this station when 
the transmit frequency of the contact station is 
shifted.
The display will indicate “CLAR RX” → “CLAR 
TX” → “CLAR RXTX” in red, each time the 
[CLAR] key is pressed, and the clarifier will ac-
tivate.
To adjust the offset frequency of the clarifier, 
turn the “MAIN DIAL” for the MAIN-side, or the 
“SUB DIAL” for the SUB-side.
To turn the clarifier OFF, repeatedly press the 
[CLAR] key until the Clarifier status is not dis-
played.
To clear out the programmed clarifier offset al-
together, and reset it to “zero,” press and hold 
the [CLAR] key.
•	RX Clarifier
If the transmit frequency of the contact station 
deviates, this receiver clarifier frequency can 
be changed leaving this transmit frequency un-
changed.
1.	 Press the [CLAR] key.
2.	 Rotate the MAIN dial knob to change only 
the receive frequency.
When the receive frequency is offset by +20Hz.
Offsets of up to ±9995Hz may be set us-
ing the Clarifier.
•	Adjust transmit frequency to the 
offset frequency
After changing the receiver frequency with RX 
Clarifier, the transmitter frequency can be set 
to the same frequency as the receiver.
1.	 After offsetting the receiver frequency, press 
the [CLAR] key twice.
The transmit frequency becomes the same 
as the receive frequency. “CLAR RX” of the 
display changes to “CLAR RXTX”.
2.	 Press the [CLAR] key twice, only the re-
ceive frequency returns to the offset state.
“CLAR RXTX” of the display changes to 
“CLAR RX”.
•	TX Clarifier
The transmit frequency can be changed with-
out moving the receive frequency of the trans-
ceiver. Normally, the clarifier is used to move 
only the receive frequency and compensate for 
the deviation of the transmission frequency of 
the contact station, however alternatively, only 
the transmit frequency can be moved without 
changing the transmitter. When responding to 
an operator that is called by a large number of 
stations such as in a contest, etc.,
the response rate may increase if the transmit 
frequency is moved slightly.
1.	 Press the [CLAR] key twice.
2.	 Rotate the MAIN dial knob to change only 
the transmit frequency.
Offsets of up to ±9995Hz may be set us-
ing the Clarifier.
3.	 To cancel Clarifier operation, press the 
[CLAR] key twice.
To clear out the programmed clarifier offset al-
together, and reset it to “zero”, press and hold

Using the Automatic Antenna Tuner (FTX-1 optima only)
The Automatic Antenna Tuner (ATU) is built into each FTX-1 optima. The ATU is designed to ensure 
that a 50-Ohm antenna impedance load is presented to the final amplifier stage of the transmitter.
•	Because the FTX-1 optima ATU is located inside transceiver, it can only adjust the imped-
ance presented to the transceiver end of the coaxial cable feedline. It does not “tune” the 
SWR at the antenna feed point itself.
•	When designing and building an antenna system, we recommend that every effort be made 
to also ensure a low SWR at the antenna feed point.
•	The ATU in the FTX-1 optima is designed to match impedances within the range of 16.7 
Ohms to 150 Ohms, corresponding to an SWR of 3:1 or less on the HF amateur bands (6 
m amateur band: 25 Ohms to 100 Ohms, corresponding to an SWR of 2:1 or less). Accord-
ingly, simple non-resonant whip antennas, along with random-length wires and the “G5RV” 
antenna (on most bands) may not be within the impedance matching range of the ATU.
•	The built-in antenna tuner cannot be used with an antenna connector connected to an exter-
nal antenna tuner.
•	ATU Operation
1.	 Press and hold the [FUNC] knob.
2.	 Touch [TUNER] to place the ATU in the 
transmit line (no adjustment or tuning will 
occur yet).
While the ATU function is activated, the 
“TUNE” will be displayed.
3.	 Touch [ANT TUNE] key to begin automatic 
tuning.
The transmitter will be engaged, and “TUNE” 
will be blinks while tuning is in progress.
●	 Always listen on the operating frequen-
cy before beginning the tuning process, 
to be sure tuning will not interfere with 
others who may already be using the fre-
quency.
●	 When the optimum tuning point has been 
achieved, the transceiver will return to 
receive.
●	 It is normal to hear the sound of the re-
lays while tuning is in progress.
4.	 To disengage the ATU from the transmit 
line, touch [TUNE].
About ATU Memories
SWR (After tuning) Less than 2:1
The tuner settings are stored in the ATU 
memory.
SWR (After tuning) Greater than 2:1
Tuning data will not be retained in memory.
If operation is returned to the same frequen-
cy, the tuning process must be repeated.
SWR (After tuning) Greater than 3:1
The “HI-SWR” icon will light up, and the 
tuner settings, if achieved, will not be mem-
orized.
Investigate the high SWR condition and re-
solve the problem before attempting further 
operation using this antenna.

For additional details on the following Functions, refer to the Advanced Manual which may 
be downloaded from the Yaesu website.
Tone squelch feature
The tone squelch opens the speaker audio only when a signal containing the specified CTCSS 
tone is received. By matching the CTCSS tone frequency with the partner stations, quiet standby 
monitoring is possible.
DCS (Digital Code squelch) feature
The DCS (Digital Coded Squelch) function allows audio to be heard only when signals containing 
the same DCS code are received.
DG-ID (Digital Group ID) feature
Digital Group ID (DG-ID) function allows using the two-digit ID numbers to communicate only with 
specific group members.
DP-ID (Digital Personal ID) feature
DP-ID (Digital Personal ID) feature opens the speaker audio only when a C4FM signal set to the 
same DP-ID in the Digital Mode is received.
Parametric Microphone Equalizer
The FTX-1 includes a unique Three-Band Parametric Microphone Equalizer that provides precise, 
in- dependent control over the low, mid and treble ranges in the voice waveform. One group of set-
tings may be utilized when the Speech Processor is Off, and an alternate group of settings when 
the Speech Processor is On (SSB mode only).
Adjustable Receiver Audio Filter
The FTX-1 incorporates an adjustable receiver audio filter, that affords precision control of the lower 
and upper audio ranges independently.
Change the sound quality of the received audio

For additional details on the following Functions, refer to the Advanced Manual which may 
be downloaded from the Yaesu website.
PMS (Programmable Memory scan)
This function scans only the range of frequencies between the lower and upper limits registered in 
a pair of PMS (Programmable Memory channel). 50 sets of PMS memory channels (P-01L/P-U01U 
to P-50L/P-50U) are available.
Split Memory
Two different frequencies, one for receive and another for transmit, can be registered to a memory 
channel.

VFO and Memory Scanning
Either the VFO or the memory channels of the FTX-1 may be scanned, and the receiver will halt 
scanning on any frequency with a signal strong enough to open the receiver squelch.
In the SSB/CW and SSB-based Data modes, the decimal points in the frequency display area will 
blink and the scanner will slow down (but does not stop).
VFO/Memory Scan
1.	 Set the frequency or Memory channel at 
which scanning is to begin.
2.	 Rotate the [AF/RF/SQL] knob so that the 
background noise is just silenced (page 
9).
3.	 Pressing and holding the UP or DWN key 
on the microphone will start the scanning.
● The operation when a signal is received 
during scanning varies depending on the 
mode type.
Other than 
LSB, USB
CW-L, CW-U
Scanning will pause.
LSB, USB
CW-L, CW-U
Scanning speed will be 
slower, but scanning will not 
be paused.
● If the scan has paused on a signal, press-
ing the microphone UP or DWN button 
will cause scanning to resume instantly.
● If the MAIN Tuning Dial (MAIN-side)/SUB 
DIAL (SUB-side) knob is rotated while scan-
ning is in progress, the VFO scanning or 
memory channel scanning will continue up or 
down in accordance with the direction of the 
Dial Knob rotation. (In other words, if the dial 
is rotated to the left when scanning toward a 
higher frequency or memory channel num-
ber, the direction of the scan will reverse.)
To cancel scanning, press the PTT switch.
If the microphone PTT button is pressed during 
scanning, the scanner will halt at once. Howev-
er, pressing the PTT button while scanning will 
not cause transmission.
● During MAG operation, only the channels 
within the current Group will be scanned.
● The manner in which the scanner resumes 
after it has paused on a signal may be se-
lected by using Menu item [OPERATION 
SETTING] → [BAND/SCAN] → [SCAN RE-
SUME].
The default “BUSY” setting will cause the 
scan will continue to pause while receiving 
the signal.

Optional Accessories
FC-40 External Automatic Antenna Tuner (for Wire Antenna)
The FC-40 makes use of the control circuitry built into the transceiver, which allows the operator to 
control and monitor automatic operation of the FC-40, which mounts near the antenna feedpoint. 
The FC-40 uses specially selected, thermally stable components, and is housed in a waterproof 
case to withstand severe environmental conditions with high reliability.
A carefully-chosen combination of solid-state switching components and high-speed relays allows 
the FC-40 to match a wide variety of antennas to within a 2:1 SWR on any amateur band frequency 
(160 through 6 meters), typically in less than eight seconds. Transmitter power required for match-
ing may be as little as 4 - 60 Watts, and matching settings are automatically stored in memory for
