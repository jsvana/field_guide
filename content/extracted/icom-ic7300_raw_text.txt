============================================================

i
Thank you for choosing this Icom product. The IC-7300 HF/50 MHz TRANSCEIVER is designed and built with Icom’s 
state of the art technology and craftsmanship. With proper care, this product should provide you with years of 
trouble-free operation. We appreciate you making the IC-7300 your transceiver of choice, and hope you agree 
with Icom’s philosophy of “technology first.” Many hours of research and development went into the design of 
your IC-7300.
FEATURES
•• RF Direct Sampling System
  The IC-7300 employs an RF direct sampling system. 
RF signals are directly converted to digital data and 
processed in the FPGA. This system is a leading 
technology marking an epoch in amateur radio.
•• Real-Time Spectrum Scope
  The spectrum scope is class-leading in resolution, 
sweep speed and dynamic range. When you touch the 
scope screen on the intended signal, the touched area is 
magnified. The large 4.3 inch color TFT touch LCD offers 
intuitive operation.
•• New “IP+” Function
  The new IP Plus function improves 3rd order intercept 
point (IP3) performance. When a weak signal is received 
adjacent to strong interference, the AD converter is 
optimized against signal distortion. 
•• Class Leading RMDR and Phase Noise 
Characteristics
  The RMDR is improved to about 97dB (typical value) and 
Phase Noise characteristics are also improved about 
15dB (at 1 kHz frequency separation) compared to the 
IC-7200. 
•• A 4.3 inch touch screen color display
•• A built-in automatic antenna tuner
•• Multi-function control for easy settings
SUPPLIED ACCESSORIES
LDifferent types of accessories may be supplied, or may 
not be supplied depending on the transceiver version.

About the 5 MHz frequency band operation (USA version only)
Operation on the 5 MHz frequency band is allowed 
on 5 discrete frequencies and you must adhere to the 
following:
•• The USB, USB Data, PSK, and CW modes.
•• Maximum of 100 watts ERP (Effective Radiated 
Power)
•• Maximum 2.8 kHz bandwidth
It is your responsibility to set all controls so that 
transmission in this frequency band meets the 
stringent conditions under which amateur operations 
may use these frequencies.
TIP: We recommend that you save these 
frequencies, modes and filter settings into memory 
channels, for easy recall.
NOTE: To assist you in operating within the rules specified 
by the FCC, transmission is illegal on any frequencies 
other than the five shown in the tables below.
For the USB and USB data modes:
The FCC specifies center frequencies on the 5 MHz 
frequency band. However, the transceiver displays 
carrier frequency. Therefore, tune the transceiver 
to 1.5 kHz below the specified FCC channel center 
frequency.

Using the Twin PBT
SSB, CW, RTTY and AM modes
In general, the Twin PBT (Passband Tuning) 
electronically narrows the IF passband width by 
shifting the IF frequency to slightly outside of the IF 
filter passband, to reject interference. The IC-7300 
uses DSP for the PBT function.
You can narrow the IF passband width by rotating 
both TWIN PBT CLR  inner (PBT1) and outer (PBT2) to 
the opposite direction from each other.
LYou can see the nearby signal using the Spectrum Scope 
(Section 5).
1.	 Rotate TWIN PBT CLR  inner (PBT1) and outer 
(PBT2) to the opposite direction from each other.

•• SHARP
	 This selection is to emphasize the passband width of 
the filter. The filter has an almost ideal shape factor. 
Signals of the out of passband are extremely filtered 
out and it gives you better audio quality.
•• SOFT
	 The filter shoulders are roundly formed as in analog 
filters. This decreases noise components in the 
high and low frequencies of the filter passband 
and increases the S/N of the target signal. These 
characteristics play an effective role in picking up 
very weak signals in the 50 MHz band, for example. 
The shape factor is kept, and the sharpness of the 
bandpass is excellent.

D
DSquelch status
Scans work with the squelch status.
Be sure to adjust the squelch level according to your 
operating conditions.
LWhen AF
RF/SQL  operates as only an RF gain 
control, you cannot adjust the squelch level.
LNormally, set AF
RF/SQL  to the point where noise 
disappears, and the TX/RX indicator goes off.
When the scan starts with the squelch open:
•• For a Programmed scan
When the tuning step is 1 kHz or less, the scan 
continues until it is manually stopped— it does not 
pause* even if signals are detected.
*The scan pauses when the squelch is closed and then 
opened. The scan resumes after 10 seconds has passed 
when the Scan Resume function is ON. It is cancelled 
when the function is OFF.
When the tuning step is 5 kHz or more, the scan 
pauses on each step when the Scan Resume function 
is ON. It does not pause when the function is OFF.
•• For a memory scan
The scan pauses on each channel when the Scan 
Resume function is ON. The scan does not pause 
when the function is OFF.
When the scan starts with the squelch closed:
The scan stops when a signal is detected.
•• When the Scan Resume function is ON, the scan pauses

ANTENNA TUNER OPERATION
11-2
About the internal antenna tuner
The internal automatic antenna tuner automatically 
matches the transceiver to the antenna within the 
range of 16.7 ~ 150 Ω (SWR of less than 3:1).
When the tuner has matched an antenna over some 
period of operating time, latching relays of up to 100 
combinations have been memorized as preset points. 
If the frequency is tuned over ± 1.5% of the current 
memorized frequency point, the tuner uses the relay 
combinations of the next memorized point (if it is 
within ± 1.5% of the new frequency). If there are no 
memorized points with the range, the tuner switches 
to bypass.
•• When you install a new antenna, or you want to 
change the antenna settings, you can clear the all 
of the internal antenna tuner preset points with the 
“<<Preset Memory Clear>>” item on the TUNER set 
screen. (p. 12-5)
MENU  » SET > Function > Tuner >  
<<Preset Memory Clear>>
•• You can select whether or not to save the internal 
antenna tuner’s status after pushing TUNER  on each 
band in the “[TUNER] Switch” item on the TUNER 
set screen. (p. 12-5)
MENU  » SET > Function > Tuner > 
[TUNER] Switch
NOTE: When the transceiver receives a strong physical 
shock, some of the internal latching relays may unlatch. In 
that case, push TUNER  to turn OFF the tuner, then turn 
ON again to reset all the latching relays.
Internal antenna tuner operation
1.	 Push TUNER  to turn ON the internal antenna 
tuner.
•• “TUNE” is displayed when the tuner is ON.
2.	 Tune the antenna.
LTo tune the antenna, see “Manual tuning” or “PTT 
Tuner start” below.
D
DManual tuning
You can manually tune the antenna before 
transmitting for the first time.
1.	 Hold down TUNER  for 1 second to start manual 
tuning.
•• The tuner reduces the SWR to less than 1.5:1 after 
2~3 seconds of tuning.
LWhile tuning, a side tone is heard and “TUNE” blinks 
red.
2.	 After tuning, “TUNE” is displayed.
LIf the tuner cannot tune, “TUNE” disappears and the 
tuning circuit is automatically bypassed
D
DPTT Tuner start
The tuner is always activated when PTT is pushed 
after the frequency is changed (more than 1% from 
last-tuned frequency). This function tunes the antenna 
for the first transmission on a new frequency.
LThis function can be turned ON in the “PTT Start” 
item of the TUNER set screen. (p. 12-5)
MENU  » SET > Function > Tuner > PTT Start
NOTE: If the SWR is higher than about 1.5:1, hold down 
TUNER  for 1 second to start manual tuning.
If the tuner cannot tune the antenna
•• Repeat manual tuning several times.
•• Even if the tuner cannot tune the antenna on the first 
tuning, it may success at the second tuning.
•• Some antennas, especially for the low bands, have a 
narrow bandwidth. These antennas may not tune at 
the edge of their bandwidth, therefore, tune such an 
antenna as follows: 
(Example):  
Suppose you have an antenna which has an SWR of 
1.5:1 at 3.55 MHz and an SWR of 3:1 at 3.8 MHz.
1.	Set 3.55 MHz, and hold down TUNER  for 1 
second to start manual tuning.
2.	Set 3.80 MHz, and hold down TUNER  for 1 
second to start manual tuning.

ANTENNA TUNER OPERATION
11-3
About an external antenna tuner
The optional AH-4 antenna tuner matches the IC-
7300 to a long wire antenna more than 7 m/23 ft long 
(3.5 MHz and above).
During mobile operation, the optional AH-2b antenna 
element matches the IC-7300 to a whip antenna more 
than 2.5 m/8.2 ft long (7 ~ 50 MHz).
The optional AH-740 automatic tuning antenna 
covers 2.5 to 30 MHz range with a supplied whip 
antenna.
R DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE!
NEVER touch the antenna element while tuning or 
transmitting. Always install it in a secure place.
NEVER operate the AH-4 or AH-740 without an antenna 
connected. The tuner and transceiver will be damaged.
D
DUsing the AH-4 or AH-740
1.	 Turn ON the transceiver.
•• “TUNE” is displayed.
LEach time you push TUNER , “TUNE” is displayed 
or goes out, and the AH-4 or AH-740 is turned ON or 
OFF (bypassed).
2.	 Hold down TUNER  for 1 second to start manual 
tuning.
•• The tuner reduces the SWR to less than 2:1 after 2~3 
seconds of tuning.
LWhile tuning, a side tone is heard and “TUNE” blinks 
red.
LIf the tuner cannot reduce the SWR to less than 2:1 
after 15 seconds of tuning, “TUNE” goes out.
3.	 After tuning, “TUNE” is displayed.
LWhen the long wire antenna cannot be tuned, “TUNE” 
goes out. In that case, the AH-4 is bypassed and the 
wire is directly connected.
NOTE: When the wire antenna cannot be tuned, confirm 
wire length and connection.
Note that the AH-4 cannot tune a wire that is a ½λ long or 
on a multiple of that frequency.
D
DUsing an external antenna tuner
When you use a non-Icom external antenna tuner, 
be sure to turn OFF the internal antenna tuner before 
connecting the external antenna tuner.
Otherwise, the tuning may fail because both antenna 
tuners (internal and external) will simultaneously start 
tuning.
See the antenna tuner’s instruction manual for details.
NOTE: Be sure not to connect the antenna tuner without 
an antenna connected. This could damage the transceiver 
or external antenna tuner.
TIP: If the SWR is not reduced to 2:1 after retuning, see 
“If the tuner cannot tune the antenna” (p. 13-2) for details.

NOTE: The backup battery for the internal clock
The IC-7300 has a rechargeable Lithium battery to backup 
the internal clock. If you connect the transceiver to a 
power source, the battery is charged and it keeps the 
correct clock setting. However, if you do not connect the 
transceiver to a power source for a long period of time, the 
battery will discharge. In that case, the transceiver resets 
the internal clock.
If you do not use the transceiver for a long period, we 
recommend that you connect the transceiver to a power 
source at least once a month. The charging period is two 
days whether the transceiver’s power is ON or OFF.

*2 You can change the pin 12 setting in the “ACC/USB 
Output Select” item on the CONNECTORS set screen. 
If the pin is set to IF, the transceiver outputs a 12 kHz IF 
signal from [ACC]. In that case, you can listen to the DRM 
broadcast with the application software receiver that is 
installed into your PC.
*3 You can change the input level in the “ACC MOD Level” 
item on the CONNECTORS set screen. (p.12-7) 
100 mV rms is at the 50% (default) setting.
*4 You can change the output level in the “ACC/USB AF 
Output Level” item on the CONNECTORS set screen.  
(p. 12-7) 
Approximately 200 mV rms is at the 50% (default) setting.
*1 When the SEND terminal controls an inductive load, such 
as a relay, a counter-electromotive force can malfunction 
or damage the transceiver. To prevent this, we recommend 
adding a switching diode, such as an 1SS133, on the load 
side of the circuit to absorb the counter-electromotive force. 
When the diode is added, a delay in relay switching may 
occur. Be sure to check its switching action before operating.

ABOUT CE
INSTALLATION NOTES
For amateur base station installations it is recommended 
that the forward clearance in front of the antenna array is 
calculated relative to the EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated 
Power). The clearance height below the antenna array can 
be determined in most cases from the RF power at the 
antenna input terminals.
As different exposure limits have been recommended for 
different frequencies, a relative table shows a guideline for 
installation considerations. 
Below 30 MHz, the recommended limits are specified in 
terms of V/m or A/m fields as they are likely to fall within the 
near-field region. Similarly, the antennas may be physically 
short in terms of electrical length and that the installation will 
require some antenna matching device which can create 
local, high intensity magnetic fields. Analysis of such MF 
installations is best considered in association with published 
guidance notes such as the FCC OET Bulletin 65 Edition 
97-01 and its annexes relative to amateur transmitter 
installations. The EC recommended limits are almost 
identical to the FCC specified ‘uncontrolled’ limits and tables 
exist that show pre-calculated safe distances for different 
antenna types for different frequency bands. Further 
information can be found at http://www.arrl.org/.
•• Typical amateur radio installation
Exposure distance assumes that the predominant radiation 
pattern is forward and that radiation vertically downwards 
is at unity gain (sidelobe suppression is equal to main lobe 
gain). This is true of almost every gain antenna today. 
Exposed persons are assumed to be beneath the antenna 
array and have a typical height of 1.8 m.
The figures assume the worst case emission of a constant 
carrier.
For the bands 10 MHz and higher the following power 
density limits have been recommended:
	
10–50 MHz 2 W/sq m
Vertical clearance by EIRP output
	
	     1 Watts 2.1 m
	
	   10 Watts 2.8 m
	
	   25 Watts 3.4 m
	
  100 Watts 5 m
	
1000 Watts 12 m
Forward clearance by EIRP output
	
       100 Watts 2 m
	
     1000 Watts 6.5 m
	
  10,000 Watts 20 m
	
100,000 Watts 65 m
In all cases any possible risk depends on the transmitter 
being activated for long periods. (actual recommendation 
limits are specified as an average during 6 minutes) 
Normally the transmitter is not active for long periods of 
time. Some radio licenses will require that a timer circuit 
automatically cuts the transmitter after 1–2 minutes etc.
Similarly some types of emission, i.e., SSB, CW, AM etc. 
have a lower ‘average’ output power and the assessed risk 
is even lower.
