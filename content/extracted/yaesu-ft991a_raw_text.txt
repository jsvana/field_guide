About This Manual . . .
The FT-991A is a leading-edge transceiver with a number of new and exciting features, some of which may be unfamil-
iar to you. In order to gain the most enjoyment and operating efficiency from your FT-991A, we recommend that you 
read this manual in its entirety, and keep it handy for reference as you explore the many capabilities of your new trans-
ceiver.
Before using your FT-991A, be sure to read and follow the instructions in the “Before You Begin” section of this manu-
al.
About TFT Displays
FT-991A utilizes a TFT liquid-crystal display.
•	
Although TFT liquid-crystal displays are made using very precise technology, they are prone to develop 
dead pixels (dark dot) or pixels that are always on (bright dot). Please understand that such phenomena 
do not constitute product defects or malfunctions. Rather, this phenomena occurs due to limitations in the 
manufacturing technology with respect to TFT liquid-crystal displays.
•	
Depending on the viewing angle, unevenness in color or brightness may occur. Please note that any uneven-
ness observed is inherent to the construction of TFT liquid crystal displays and therefore does not constitute 
a product defect or malfunction.
•	
If your TFT liquid-crystal display becomes dirty, please use a dry soft cloth or tissue to wipe the display 
clean. Use of glass cleaner, household cleaners, organic solvents, alcohol, abrasives, and/or like substance 
may damage the TFT liquid-crystal display.

FT-991  Operating Manual
General Description
Built-in high-brightness TFT full-color 
display with touch-panel functionality
The FT-991A is equipped with a 3.5 inch full-color TFT 
display. Functions, including the receiving band, the noise 
and signal interference reduction tools are graphically 
displayed. Even while performing rigorous operations, 
during DX pditions or contests, the operator may instantly 
grasp the status of each function.
Equipped with C4FM digital mode
This transceiver C4FM mode provides good error cor-
rection performance, and supports the V/D mode (voice/
data simultaneous transmission mode) which makes the 
transceiver suitable for mobile communication, and the 
Voice FR mode (voice full rate mode) which allows the 
transceiver to transmit high quality digital audio. The AMS 
function recognizes the contacting stations transmission 
method and automatically switches the transceiver to the 
same C4FM digital or analog (FM) communications mode 
as the received signal.
DG-ID (Digital Group ID) feature, 
the Group Monitor (GM) feature 
enables automatically locating, and 
communicating with other stations that 
have the same DG-ID number within 
contact range.
The two-digit DG-ID numbers (00 to 99) can be set 
separately for Transmit and Receive. By setting both 
transmit and receive to “00”, communication with all 
the other stations in the digital C4FM mode is possible, 
regardless of their DG-ID number setting. Matching the 
transmit DG-ID number to the uplink DG-ID number set 
in the DR-2X System Fusion II digital repeater, will permit 
access to the digital repeater DR-2X used by the club.
DP-ID (Digital Personal ID) feature may 
communicate only by the transceivers 
registered the individual ID information.
Every C4FM digital transmit communication contains 
the individual ID information (Radio ID) of each 
transceiver. The DP-ID function uses this individual ID 
information. When the DP-IDs of the transceiver are 
registered with each other, they can communicate even 
if the DG-ID numbers are different. By registering the 
DP-ID of the transceiver to the DR-2X System Fusion II 
digital repeater, the digital repeater may be controlled by 
remote operation. 
G M  ( g r o u p  m o n i t o r )  f u n c t i o n 
automatically inquires to find if there 
are any stations with the GM function in 
operation on the same frequency within 
communication range. The members 
may then automatically exchange (send/
receive) station location information.
The transceiver automatically checks the channel fre-
quency for registered member stations that are within com-
municating range.  The distance and direction information 
of the call sign members of the group may be shown on 
the TFT display.
Comes equipped with two types of 
roofing filters
This transceiver is equipped with two types of roofing fil-
ters for 3 kHz and 15 kHz bandwidths. These narrow band 
filters are especially useful on a very crowded band during 
contests, because they can dramatically attenuate powerful 
out-of-band signals in the first IF stage and reduce their 
impact in the second stage to further optimizing the excel-
lent dynamic range and IP3 characteristics for processing 
signals ranging from faint to powerful.
Two selectable RF amplifiers provide the 
optimal receiver gain for each low-to high 
HF band (see page 48.)
Configure the front end RF circuitry for the precise gain and 
performance to suit the conditions of each HF band.Select 
the IPO (Intercept Point Optimization) feature to optimize 
the proximal multi-signal and mutual modulation character-
istics in order to minimize the effects of powerful broadcast 
stations, especially in the low-band so that even the faintest 
signals can be received. When higher gain is advantageous, 
select the single low noise RF amplifier  AMP1. In the high 
bands, adding AMP2 provides maximum useful gain.
High stability built-in TCXO
The 30.225 MHz standard oscillator provides exceptional 
frequency stability. It is temperature compensated and boasts 
an enhanced ±0.5 ppm stability from −10°C to +50°C.
WIDTH feature and continuously variable 
bandwidth SHIFT feature. Optimal wide to 
narrow bandwidth switching (see pages 
51, 52.)
The SHIFT feature, can eliminate interference in one side 
of the passband. The WIDTH feature allows the bandwidth 
to be narrowed by rotating the WIDTH knob. The moment 
weak signals disappear due to interfering signals (includ-
ing pile-ups), you can eliminate the interfering signals and 
extract only the desired signal, thanks to the unique DSP 
sharp filtering characteristic.
CONTOUR feature is renowned for 
effective noise control (see page 50.)
Rather than using the DSP extremely sharp attenuation 
characteristics, the CONTOUR circuit provides gentle 
shaping of the DSP passband filter and can thus attenuate 
or peak bandwidth components in segments. The interfer-
ing signal can be naturally shaped without having part of 
the signal suddenly interrupted. The contour function is 
very effective in making the desired signal rise out of the 
interference.

FT-991  Operating Manual
General Description
DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) by DSP 
digital processing (see page 56.)
The incorporated digital noise reduction circuit may be 
set to the optimal working point by varying the 15 step 
parameters according to the noise type.
NOTCH feature that significantly 
eliminates unwanted beat signals; and 
DNF feature that instantly attenuates 
multiple beat signals (see page 56.)
When interfering beat signals are present in the receiver 
passband, the IF NOTCH feature can significantly elimi-
nate a part of the passband and remove the beat signal. 
Moreover, the function is equipped with an Automatic 
Tracking System DNF (Digital Notch Filter) that can 
be engaged by DSP when there are multiple interfering 
signals, even when the frequency is changing.
Reliable High-output Final Amplifier 
Stage
In the HF/50MHz frequency range, a pair of RD100HHF1 
transistors in a push-pull RF amplifier arrangement deliv-
ers 100 watts of low-distortion, high-quality transmitter 
power. The final amplifier for the 144 MHz/430 MHz 
bands uses the high-output RDH70HUF2 device, provid-
ing ample output power of 50 watts.
Microphone Amplifier that includes 
Parametric Equalizer (see page 65.)
The microphone amplifier equalizer feature is equipped 
with a three-stage parametric equalizer that can alter the 
Low, Mid, and High frequencies of the audio separately; 
this feature permits the bandwidth and gain for each part of 
the audio spectrum to be precisely adjusted independently.
Real-Time Spectrum Scope and Multi-Color 
Waterfall Display (see page 42.)
The spectrum scope function provides a visual display of 
the strength and distribution of signals across the band in 
real time. The Waterfall Display Mode portrays color dif-
ferentiation between strong and weak signals.
High speed antenna tuner (see page 63.)
The transceiver is equipped with the relay switching high 
speed digital tuner which supports 1.8 MHz to 50 MHz. 
The large 100-channel tuning data memory allows im-
mediate recall of the optimum matching conditions for 
previously tuned frequencies.
Optional Five Channel Message Memory 
(voice memory) (see page 70.)
You can use the 5 channel voice memory function which 
is useful for operating in contests, etc. This voice memory 
enables recording of up to 20 seconds of audio for each 
message you want to send.
Custom selection (C.S) button (see page 39.)
This feature lets you select any Menu item for one-touch 
access via the C.S button.

Antenna Considerations
The FT-991A is designed for use with any antenna system providing a 50 Ohm resistive impedance at the desired op-
erating frequency. While minor excursions from the 50-Ohm specification are of no consequence, if the Standing Wave 
Ratio (SWR) present at the Antenna jack is greater than 3:1, the transceiver’s Automatic Antenna Tuner may not be able 
to reduce the impedance mismatch to an acceptable value.
Every effort should be made to ensure that the impedance of the antenna system be as close as possible to the specified 
50-Ohm value. Note that the “G5RV” type antenna does not provide a 50-Ohm impedance on all HF Amateur bands. An 
external wide-range antenna coupler must be used with this antenna type.
Any antenna to be used with the FT-991A must be fed from the transceiver with 50 Ohm coaxial cable. Therefore, 
when using a “balanced” antenna such as a dipole, remember that a balun or other matching/balancing device must be 
used to ensure proper antenna performance.
The same precautions apply to any additional (receive-only) antennas connected to the antenna jacks. If the receive only 
antennas do not have impedance near 50 Ohms at the operating frequency, It may be necessary to install an external an-
tenna tuner to obtain optimum performance.
About Coaxial Cable
Use high-quality 50-Ohm coaxial cable for the lead-in to your FT-991A transceiver. All efforts at providing an efficient 
antenna system will be wasted if poor quality, lossy coaxial cable is used. This transceiver utilizes standard “M” (“PL-
259”) type connectors.

Grounding
The FT-991A transceiver, like any other HF communications apparatus, requires an effective ground system for maxi-
mum electrical safety and best communications effectiveness. A good ground system can contribute to station efficiency 
in a number of ways:
	 It can minimize the possibility of electrical shock to the operator.
	 It can minimize RF currents flowing on the shield of the coaxial cable and the chassis of the transceiver. Such cur-
rents may lead to radiation, which can cause interference to home entertainment devices or laboratory test equip-
ment.
	 It can minimize the possibility of erratic transceiver/accessory operation caused by RF feedback and/or improper 
current flow through logic devices.
An effective earth ground system may take several forms. For a more complete discussion, see an appropriate RF engi-
neering text. The information below is intended only as a guideline.
Typically, the ground connection consists of one or more copper-clad steel rods, driven into the ground. If multiple 
ground rods are used, they should be positioned in a “V” configuration and bonded together at the base of the “V” which 
is nearest the station location. Use a heavy, braided cable (such as the discarded shield from type RG-213 coaxial cable) 
and strong cable clamps to secure the braided cable(s) to the ground rods. Be sure to weatherproof the connections 
to ensure many years of reliable service. Use the same type of heavy, braided cable for the connections to the station 
ground bus (described below).
Inside the station, a common ground bus consisting of a copper pipe of at least 25 mm diameter should be used. An al-
ternative station ground bus may consist of a wide copper plate (single-sided circuit board material is ideal) secured to 
the bottom of the operating desk. Grounding connections from individual transceivers, power supplies, and data com-
munications devices (TNCs, etc.) should be made directly to the ground bus using a heavy, braided cable.
Do not “Daisy-Chain” ground connections from one electrical device to another and thence to the ground bus. This 
method may nullify any attempt at effective radio frequency grounding. See the drawing below for examples of proper 
grounding techniques.
Inspect the ground system - inside the station as well as outside - on a regular basis to ensure continued performance 
and safety.
Besides following the above guidelines carefully, note that household or industrial gas lines must never be used in an 
attempt to establish an electrical ground. Cold water pipes may, in some instances, help in the grounding effort, but gas 
lines represent a significant explosion hazard, and must never be used.

Before You Begin
Connection of Antenna and Power Cables
Please follow the outline in the illustration regarding the proper connection of antenna coaxial cables, as well as the DC 
power cable. The DC power connector for the FT-991A must only be connected to a DC source providing 13.8 Volts DC 
(±15 %), and capable of at least 23 Amperes of current. Always observe proper polarity when making DC connection:
The RED DC power lead connects to the Positive (+) DC terminal.
The BLACK DC power lead connects to the Negative (–) DC terminal.
We recommend the use of the FP-1030A (USA market only) AC Power Supply. Other models of power supplies may 
be used with the FT-991A, but the 13.8 VDC input voltage, 23 Ampere current capability, and DC cable polarity guide-
lines described above must be strictly followed.
Note that other manufacturers may use the same type of DC power connections as the FT-991A transceiver; however, 
the wiring configuration may be different from that specified for the FT-991A transceiver. Serious damage can be 
caused if improper DC connections are made; consult with a qualified service technician when in doubt.
High RF voltage is present in the TX RF section of the transceiver while transmitting.
Absolutely! Do not touch the TX RF section while transmitting.
Permanent damage can result when improper supply voltage, or reverse-polarity voltage, is applied to the FT-
991A. The Limited Warranty on this transceiver does not cover damage caused by application of AC voltage, re-
verse polarity DC, or DC voltage outside the specified range of 13.8 V ±15 %. When replacing fuses, be certain 
to use a fuse of the proper rating. The FT-991A requires a 25 Amp blade fuse.
Note:
	 Do not place the FT-991A in a location with direct exposure to sunshine.
	 Do not place the FT-991A in a location exposed to dust and/or high humidity.
	 Ensure adequate ventilation around the FT-991A, to prevent heat build-up and possible reduction of performance 
due to high heat.
	 Do not install the FT-991A on an unstable desk or table. Do not place it in a location where objects may fall onto it 
from above.
	 To minimize the possibility of interference to home entertainment devices, take all precautionary steps including 
separation of TV/FM antennas from Amateur transmitting antennas to the greatest extent possible, and keep trans-
mitting coaxial cables separated from cables connected to home entertainment devices.
	 Ensure that the DC power cord is not subject to undue stress or bending, which could damage the cable or cause it to 
be accidentally unplugged from the rear panel DC IN jack.
	 Be certain to install your transmitting antenna(s) so they cannot possibly come in contact with TV/FM radio or other 
antennas, or with power or telephone lines.
Check the DC volt-
age and current 
rating (+13.8 V, 23 A) of the 
power supply before con-
necting to the transceiver.
To prevent damage from lightning, at-
mospheric electricity, electrical shock 
etc., please provide a good earth ground.
Use a short, thick, braided cable to connect your 
station equipment to the 
buried ground rod (or 
alternative earth ground 
system).

The FT-991A includes many features for the CW operator. These functions will be detailed in the “CW Mode Opera-
tion” section later. This 3.5 mm, 3-contact jack accepts a CW key or keyer paddles (for the built-in electronic keyer), or 
the output from an external electronic keyer.
The Menu selections permit configuring the front panel KEY jack according to the device connected. For example, a 
keyer paddle may be connected to the front panel KEY jack, and Menu item “012 KEYER TYPE” used to select paddle 
input.
The KEY jack on the FT-991A utilize “Positive” keying voltage. Key-up voltage is approximately +3.3V DC, and key-
down current is approximately 4 mA. When connecting a key or other device to the KEY jack, use only a 3-contact 
(“stereo”) 3.5 mm phone plug; a 2-contact plug will place a short between the ring and shaft (ground) of the plug, result-
ing in a constant “key-down” condition in some circumstances.

displayed by pressing the BAND button. Each 
Amateur band key may similarly have up to three 
frequency/mode settings applied. See page 39 
for details.
6.	 Press the MODE button to display the available se-
lections.
	
Touch the corresponding key to select the desired 
operating mode.
Advice:
	 By convention in the Amateur bands, LSB is 
used on the 7 MHz and lower bands (with the 
exception of 60 meters), while USB is utilized on 
the 14 MHz and higher bands.
	 When changing modes from SSB to CW, you 
will observe a frequency shift on the display. 
This shift represents the BFO offset between the 
“zero beat” frequency and the audible CW pitch 
(tone) you can hear (the pitch is programmed via 
the Menu item “059 CW FREQ DISPLAY”), even 
though the actual tone that you hear is not chang-
ing.
	 To eliminate noise while the transceiver is not re-
ceiving any signal, press the F(M-LIST) button, 
then touch [SQL] on the LCD. “SQL” will ap-
pear on the LCD and the MULTI knob will func-
tion as the squelch knob. Rotate the MULTI knob 
to adjust the squelch until the noise disappears.
1.	 Turn on the external DC power supply.
2.	 Press and hold in the front-panel ON/OFF switch 
until the transceiver turns on.
3.	 The transceiver will start up on 7.000.00 MHz LSB,

normal operation may begin.
Note:
	
To turn power off, press and hold in the front panel 
ON/OFF switch for one second.
4.	 Rotate the AF GAIN knob to set a comfortable au-
dio level of the incoming signals or noise. Clockwise 
rotation of the AF GAIN knob increases the volume 
level.
Note:
	
When using headphones, start by rotating the AF 
GAIN knob counter-clockwise, then bring the vol-
ume level up after you put the headphones on. This 
will minimize the chance of damage to your hearing 
caused by an unexpectedly high audio level.
5.	 Press the BAND button to display the list of Amateur 
bands on the LCD, then touch a key corresponding 
to the band on which you wish to begin operation.
Advice:
	 One-touch selection of each Amateur band be-
tween 1.8 and 50 MHz, 144 MHz, and 430 MHz 
is provided.
	 Touch and hold [14] on the screen displayed by 
pressing the BAND button to selection 5 MHz is 
provided.
	 The FT-991A utilizes a triple band-stack VFO 
selection technique, which permits storing up to 
three favorite frequencies and modes onto each 
VFO band register. For example, you may store 
one frequency each on 14 MHz CW, RTTY, and 
USB, then recall these frequencies by successive, 
momentary touches of the [14] on the screen

CLAR (Clarifier) Operation
The CLAR button and CLAR/VFO-B knob are used to offset the receive frequency, the transmit frequency, or both, 
from their settings on the VFO-A frequency. Four small numbers on the TFT Display show the current Clarifier offset. 
The Clarifier controls on the FT-991A are designed to allow setting a preset offset (up to ±9.99 kHz) without actually 
retuning, and then to activate it via the Clarifier CLAR button. This feature is ideal for following a drifting station, or 
for setting the small frequency offsets sometimes utilized in DX “Split” work.
Here is the technique for utilizing the Clarifier:
1.	 Press the CLAR button. The “RX” notation will ap-
pear in the TFT Display, and the programmed offset 
will be applied to the receive frequency.
2.	 Rotation of the CLAR/VFO-B knob will allow you 
to modify your initial offset on the fly. Offsets of up 
to ±9.99 kHz may be set using the Clarifier.
To cancel Clarifier operation, press the CLAR button. 
The “RX” notation will disappear from the display.
Advice:
Turning the Clarifier off merely cancels the applica-
tion of the programmed offset from the receive and/or 
the transmit frequencies. To clear the Clarifier offset, 
and reset it to “zero,” press and hold the CLAR button. 
The programmed offset is displayed in the small multi-
channel window of the frequency display.

Convenience Features
Receiver Operation (Front End Block Diagram)
The FT-991A includes a wide range of special features to suppress the many types of interference that may be encoun-
tered on the HF bands. However, real world interference conditions are constantly changing, so optimum setting of the 
controls is somewhat of an art, requiring familiarity with the types of interference and the subtle effects of some of the 
controls. Therefore, the following information is provided as a general guideline for typical situations, and a starting 
point for your own experimentation.
The FT-991A interference-fighting circuitry begins in its “RF” stages, and continues throughout the entire receiver sec-
tion. FT-991A allows configuration of the features described below.
CONTOUR Filter
The DSP Contour filter has the unique ability to pro-
vide either a null or a peak in tunable segments of the 
receiver passband. You may suppress interference and 
excessive frequency components of an incoming signal, 
or you may peak those tunable frequency segments. The 
level of the null or peak, and the bandwidth, over which 
it is applied, are adjustable via the Menu.
IF SHIFT
The passband center frequency of the IF DSP filter may 
be moved up or down by adjusting this control.
IF WIDTH
The width of the IF DSP filtering may be adjusted using 
this control.
IF NOTCH
The IF Notch filter is a high-Q notch filter that can elim-
inate, or significantly reduce an interfering carrier.
DNF (Digital Notch filter)
When multiple interfering carriers are encountered dur-
ing reception, the Digital Notch Filter can significantly 
reduce the level of these signals.
DNR (Digital Noise Reduction)
The DSP’s Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) feature uti-
lizes 15 different mathematical algorithms to analyze 
and suppress different noise profiles encountered on the 
HF/50 MHz bands. Choose the selection that provides 
the best noise suppression, and allows the signal to rise 
up out of the noise.
AGC
The AGC system automatically adapts to changing sig-
nal and fading characteristics, making reception possible 
under the most difficult conditions.
The FT-991A uses the 15 kHz roofing filter on 
AM/FM/C4FM modes. All the other modes use 
the 3 KHz filter automatically. There is no manual 
selection possible.

ATT (Attenuator)
When the desired signal is extremely strong or the noise level is high on a low frequency band, activate the attenuator to 
reduce the incoming signal from the antenna.
1.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [ATT] on 
the LCD. The “ATT” indicator will appear in the 
DSP display.
Advice:
	 The incoming signal level is reduced by 12dB 
(Signal voltage is reduced to 1/4 compared to OFF).
F(M-LIST) Button
Displays ATT
2.	 To restore full signal strength through the Attenuator 
circuit, touch [ATT] on the LCD to return the ATT 
display to the “OFF” position.
Advice:
If the noise level is high or the received signal is extremely strong, the incoming signal level can be suppressed with the 
IPO/ATT settings.
If the S-meter fluctuates S-3 or more in the noise level, or the received signal is extremely strong and it causes a high S-
meter indication (+20dB or more), activate the attenuator.
Since IPO does not only attenuate the incoming signal, but also improves the cross modulation characteristic, try to ac-
tivate the IPO first. If the signal is still strong, also use the ATT. In this way, you can attenuate the incoming signal and 
noise effectively.
The ATT is only available in the HF - 50MHz band.

menu list. Touch the [IPO] function repeatedly, to set 
the desired characteristic of the receiver front end, ac-
cording to the chart below.
AMP1:	Amplifies the incoming signals, using a low 
distortion RF preamplifier (gain: approx. 10 
dB).
AMP2:	Amplifies the incoming signals, using a 
2-stage low-distortion RF preamplifier (total 
gain: approx. 20 dB).
IPO:	
Bypasses the RF preamplifier, yielding direct 
feed to the first mixer.

Note:
AMP1 does not function below the 1.8 MHz frequency 
range.
The selected receiver RF preamplifier will be indicated 
in the IPO column of the Key Function Display on the 
TFT screen.
Displays IPO
Advice:
	 On the 10 MHz and lower bands, it is generally not 
necessary to use any preamplifier at all; selecting the 
“IPO” position as described above will increase the 
strong-signal-handling capability of the receiver, and 
generally result in more pleasant reception due to the 
reduced ambient noise level. If you can hear band 
noise with the preamplifiers disengaged, then a pre-
amplifier is generally not needed.
	
The IPO feature is only available in the HF - 50MHz 
band.

3.	 Rotate the MULTI knob to achieve the most natural 
sounding audio reproduction of the incoming signal.
Advice:
	 Rotate the MULTI knob to display the Contour 
center frequency (10 Hz to 3,200 Hz) below the 
[CONT] indicator.
	 The level indicator shows the amount of attenua-
tion for your reference.
4.	 To cancel Contour tuning, touch [CONT] on the 
TFT display.
Advice:
	 The Contour circuit operation will be set to “OFF”.
	 Touching [CONT] changes the Contour circuit op-
eration between “ON” and “OFF”.
	 The Contour function attenuation and bandwidth can 
be set in Menu items “112 CONTOUR LEVEL” and 
“113 CONTOUR WIDTH” (refer to the instruction 
on the right).
Refer to Figure “B”, this illustrates a “dip” in the 
center of the Contour filter passband. The Con-
tour filter places a low-Q “notch” in the passband, 
per the settings of Menu items “112 CONTOUR 
LEVEL” and “113 CONTOUR WIDTH”. Counter-
clockwise rotation of the MULTI knob causes the 
notch to move toward a lower frequency within 
the passband, while clockwise rotation causes the 
notch to move toward a higher frequency within 
the passband. By removing interference or un-
wanted frequency components of the incoming 
signal, it is possible to make the desired signal 
rise out of the background noise/interference, and 
significantly enhance intelligibility.
Quick Point:
By judicious use of the Contour filter, the “shoulder” of the passband response may be altered, or components may be 
removed from within the passband, allowing the desired signal to rise above the background noise and interference in a 
manner not obtainable with other filtering systems.

IF SHIFT Operation (SSB/CW/RTTY/DATA Modes)
IF SHIFT permits moving the DSP filter passband higher or lower, without changing the pitch of the incoming signal, 
and thus reduces or eliminates interference. Because the tuned carrier frequency is not varied, there is no need to re-tune 
the operating frequency to eliminate the interference. The total passband tuning range for the IF SHIFT system is ±1.2 
kHz.
1.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button to display the function

the [SHIFT] indicator.
	 The level indicator shows the shift offset direc-
tion for your reference.
Referring to Figure “A”, note the depiction of the 
IF DSP filter as the thick line, with MULTI knob 
in the 12 o’clock position. In Figure “B”, an in-
terfering signal has appeared inside the original

Using IF SHIFT and WIDTH Together
The IF SHIFT and Variable IF WIDTH features 
together form a very effective interference-fight-
ing filtering system.
For example, in Figure “A”, you can see how in-
terference has appeared both on the high and low 
sides of the desired signal. Touch [WIDTH] on 
the LCD, the interference from one side can be 
eliminated (Figure “B”). Next, rotate the MULTI 
knob to re-position the passband (Figure “C”), 
the interference on the opposite side can be re-
moved, without re-introducing the interference 
previously eliminated in Figure “B”.
Advice: 
The WIDTH and SHIFT features are the pri-
mary tools to use for best interference reduction. 
After narrowing the bandwidth (WIDTH) and/
or adjusting the center of the passband (SHIFT), 
the Contour control may then yield additional 
signal-enhancement benefits on the net residual 
bandwidth. Even more, the IF NOTCH Filter 
(described later) may also be used, in conjunc-
tion with these filter systems, to significant ad-
vantage.

Digital NOTCH Filter (DNF) Operation
The Digital NOTCH Filter (DNF) is an effective beat-canceling filter that can null out a number of interfering beat notes 
inside the receiver passband. Because this is an Auto-Notch feature, there is no adjustment knob associated with this fil-
ter.
Advice:
If a very strong interfering carrier is encountered, we recommend using the IF NOTCH filter first, as it is the most effec-
tive notching tool in the receiver section.
1.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button to show the functions 
listed on the TFT display, then touch [DNF] on the 
TFT display. The Digital NOTCH Filter will be set 
to “ON”.

Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) Operation
The Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) system is designed to reduce the level of ambient noise found on the HF and 50 
MHz bands. The (DNR) system is especially effective during SSB operation. While DNR is functioning, rotate the 
MULTI knob to adjust the DNR level. Any of 15 different noise-reduction algorithms can be selected; each of these al-
gorithms was created to deal with a different noise profile. You will want to experiment with the DNR system to find the 
best setting corresponding to the noise currently being experienced.
1.	 Press the F(MLIST) button to reveal the functions 
list on the TFT LCD display.
2.	 Touch [DNR] on the LCD. The DNR function will 
be set to “ON”.

RF Gain
The RF Gain control provides manual adjustment of the gain levels for the receiver RF and IF stages, to account for 
noise and signal strength conditions at the moment.
1.	 The RF GAIN knob should, initially, be rotated to 
the fully clockwise position. This is the point of 
maximum receiver sensitivity.
2.	 Counter-clockwise rotation of the RF GAIN knob 
will gradually reduce the system gain.
Advice:
	 As the RF GAIN knob is rotated counterclockwise 
to reduce the gain, the S-meter reading will rise. This 
indicates that the AGC voltage being applied to the 
receiver is increasing (this causes a reduction in re-
ceiver gain).
	 Rotating the RF GAIN knob control to the fully 
counter-clockwise position will essentially disable 
the receiver, as the gain will be greatly reduced. In 
this case, the S-meter will appear to be “pegged” 
against the right edge of the analog S-meter scale.
Quick Point:
	 Reception frequently can be improved by rotating 
the RF GAIN knob slightly counter-clockwise to the 
point where the “stationary” meter indication is set 
just about the same as the incoming noise level. This 
will reduce the RF gain to find a level of improved 
signal to noise ratio. 
	 The RF Gain control, along with the IPO and the At-
tenuator features, all affect the system receiver gain 
in different ways. The IPO generally should be the 
first feature engaged when dealing with a high noise 
level, or a crowded, high-level signal environment. 
Also, the IPO generally should be the first feature 
engaged, if the frequency is low enough to allow the 
preamplifier to be bypassed. Thereafter, the RF Gain 
and Attenuator features may be employed to provide 
precise, delicate adjustment of the receiver gain to 
fully optimize performance.

AGC (Automatic Gain Control)
The AGC system is designed to help compensate for fading and other propagation effects. The AGC characteristics can 
be individually set for each operating mode. The basic objective of AGC is to maintain a constant audio output level 
once a certain minimum threshold of signal strength is achieved.
Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [AGC] on the 
LCD repeatedly to select the desired receiver-recovery 
time constant. You will observe the AGC status notation 
in the AGC column of the Key Function Display on the 
TFT display, denoting the AGC receiver-recovery time 
currently in use. For most operations, we recommend 
the “AUTO” mode. Additionally, you may disable the 
AGC by touching [AGC] on the LCD.
F(M-LIST) Button
Note:
	 The “AUTO” selection mode selects the optimum 
receiver-recovery time for the reception mode.
	
In this case, the selected receiver-recovery time in 
the AGC column of the Key Function Display glows 
green (Normally it glows blue).
	 Touching [AGC] on the LCD allows selection of the 
desired receiver-recovery time constant. Normally, 
the “AUTO” selection is satisfactory for most situ-
ations, but in the event of operation on a crowded 
band where you wish to receive a weak signal, you 
may wish to change the setting to FAST. The AUTO 
mode selections are:
Advice:
	 If the AGC receiver-recovery time is set to “Off” by 
touching [AGC] on the LCD, the S-meter will no 
longer deflect. Additionally, you will likely encoun-
ter distortion on stronger signals, as the IF amplifiers 
and the following stages are probably being over-
loaded.
Quick point:
Several aspects of AGC performance may be configured 
via the Menu. However, because AGC can have such a 
profound impact on overall receiver performance, we 
generally do not recommend any changes to the AGC 
Menu selections until you are thoroughly familiar with 
the performance of the FT-991A.
Terminology:
Automatic Gain Control, or AGC, is a circuit that senses 
the received signal strength, and then limits the gain of 
the RF and IF stages to keep the output audio volume at 
a more-or-less constant level. AGC also protects the RF, 
IF, Audio, and DSP stages from overload, as it limits the 
signal strength that is allowed to flow, irrespective of the 
input signal level.

SSB/AM Mode Transmission
Advice:
	 ALC meter deflection may be caused by excessive 
drive power, but also by reflected power detected 
in the antenna system. If the antenna impedance 
presented to the transceiver is other than 50 Ohms, 
ALC meter action may be observed that is not re-
lated to the proper setting of [MIC GAIN] on the 
LCD. Therefore, we recommend that you make [MIC 
GAIN]  adjustments into a dummy load or antenna 
system presenting impedance very close to 50 Ohms.
	 When making “on air” tests (such as setting the mi-
crophone gain), be sure to listen on the frequency 
before transmitting, to avoid interference to others 
who may already be using the frequency.
	 Four techniques to implement Transmit/Receive con-
trol are provided on the FT-991A. You  may choose 
the technique(s) that best suit your operating needs:
	 Pressing the microphone PTT switch will engage 
the transmitter.
	 The rear panel PTT jack may be connected to a 
foot switch or other manual switching device in 
order to engage the transmitter.
	 Touching [MOX] on the TFT display functions 
list will lock the transmitter on (The functions list 
may be displayed by pressing the F(MLIST) but-
ton). Touch [MOX] on the LCD again to return to 
receive.
	 The VOX (Voice Operated Xmit) circuit will 
engage the transmitter automatically when you 
speak into the microphone. For details of VOX 
operation refer to page 72.

FT-991  Operating Manual
The Automatic Antenna Tuner (hereinafter referred to as the “ATU”) built into each FT-991A is designed to ensure a 
50-Ohm load for the final amplifier stage of the transmitter.
Advice:
	 Because the ATU of the FT-991A is located inside the station, it only adjusts the impedance presented to the trans-
ceiver at the station end of your coaxial cable feedline. It does not “tune” the SWR at the antenna feed point itself. 
When designing and building your antenna system, we recommend that every effort be made to ensure a low SWR 
at the antenna feed point.
	 The ATU of the FT-991A includes 100 memories for tuning data. Eleven of these memories are allocated, one for 
each Amateur band, so that each band has at least one setting preset for use on that band. The remaining 89 memo-
ries are reserved for the 89 most-recent tuning points, for quick frequency change without the need to retune the 
ATU.
	 The ATU in the FT-991A is designed to match impedances within the range of 16.7 Ohms to 150 Ohms, correspond-
ing to an SWR of 3:1 or less on the 160 through 6 meter amateur bands. Accordingly, simple non-resonant whip an-
tennas, along with random-length wires and the “G5RV” antenna (on most bands) may not be within the impedance 
matching range of the ATU.
ATU Operation
1.	 Use the Main Tuning Dial knob to set the radio to 
the desired operating frequency within the Amateur 
band.
2.	 Press the TUNE button momentarily to place the 
ATU in the transmit line (no adjustment/tuning will 
occur yet). The “TUNER” icon will appear in the 
display.
Quick Point:
	
The momentary press of the TUNE button will turn 
the tuner on, and the microprocessor will automati-
cally select the tuning point closest to the current 
operating frequency.
TUNE Button
3.	 Press and hold in the TUNE button for one second to 
begin automatic tuning. The transmitter will be en-
gaged, and the “TUNER” icon will blink while tun-
ing is in progress. When the optimum tuning point 
has been reached, the radio will return to receive, 
and the “TUNER” icon will again glow steadily (in-
stead of blinking).
4.	 To disconnect the ATU from the transmit line, press 
the TUNE button momentarily. The “TUNER” 
icon will turn off, confirming that the ATU has been 
turned off. In the “Off” mode, the transceiver will be 
directly connected to the coaxial cable connected to 
your antenna, and will respond to whatever imped-
ance is present at the station end of the coax.
Advice:
The ATU circuit is located between the final amplifier 
and the rear-panel antenna jack; reception is not affected 
by the ATU.
Quick Points:
As shipped from the factory, only one ATU alignment 
point is saved on each Amateur band. This was memo-
rized during the final alignment and performance verifi-
cation stages on the production line.
Note:
Please listen to the operating frequency before begin-
ning the tuning process, to be sure you are not interfer-
ing with others who may already be using the frequency.
Terminology:
Antenna Tuner Memories: The ATU microprocessor 
makes a note of the selected tuning capacitors and in-
ductors, and stores the data for each 10 kHz window in 
which tuning has occurred. This eliminates the need to 
re-tune every time you return to a frequency on which 
you have already completed the tuning process.

About ATU Operation
Figure 1 depicts a situation where normal tuning via the ATU has been successfully completed, and the tuning data has 
been stored in the ATU memory. The antenna system as seen by the transmitter is shown.
In Figure 2, the operator has changed frequency, and the “HI-SWR” icon has appeared. The operator presses and holds 
in the TUNE button for one second to begin impedance matching using the ATU.
If a high SWR condition exists (above 3:1), corrective action must be taken in the antenna system to bring the imped-
ance closer to 50 Ohms. The ATU will refuse to memorize settings on frequencies where the SWR exceeds 3:1. A High 
SWR may indicate a mechanical failure in the feed system, and can lead to the generation of spurious signals causing 
TVI, etc.
 About ATU Memories
SWR (After tuning) Less than 2:1
The tuner settings are stored in the ATU memory.
SWR (After tuning) Greater than 2:1
Tuning data will not be retained in memory. If you return to the same frequency, the tuning process must be re-
peated.
SWR (After tuning) Greater than 3:1
The “HI-SWR” icon will light up, and the tuner settings, if achieved, will not be memorized. Please investigate 
the high SWR condition and resolve the problem before attempting further operation using this antenna.

Parametric Microphone Equalizer (SSB/AM mode)
The FT-991A includes a unique Three-Band Parametric Microphone Equalizer that provides precise, independent con-
trol over the low, mid and treble ranges in the voice waveform. You may utilize one group of settings when the speech 
processor is off and use an alternate group of settings when the speech processor is on. The speech processor feature is 
described in the next chapter.
Quick Point:
The Parametric Equalizer is a unique technique for adjusting the signal quality. The three audio ranges may be adjusted 
so precisely, it is possible to craft an audio response that provides a natural and pleasant sound that you may not have 
ever experienced before. Alternately, the effective “talk power” can be significantly enhanced.
The configuration aspects that may be adjusted on the Parametric Equalizer are:
Center Frequency:	The center frequency of each of the three bands may be adjusted.
Gain:	
The amount of enhancement (or suppression) within each band may be adjusted.
Q:	
The bandwidth over which the equalization is applied may be adjusted.
Setup of the Parametric Microphone Equalizer
1.	 Connect the microphone to the MIC jack.
2.	 Set the RF output power to minimum value.
Advice:
	 We recommend that you connect a dummy load 
to one of the Antenna jacks, and monitor your 
signal on a separate receiver, to prevent interfer-
ence to other users.
	 You will have the best chance of hearing the ef-
fects of adjustments if you wear headphones 
(connected to the separate monitor receiver) 
while listening to your transmitted signal.
3.	 To adjust the Parametric Microphone Equalizer 
while the speech processor is disabled, press the 
F(M-LIST) button, then touch [MIC-EQ] to select 
“ON”.
5.	 Press the MENU(SETUP) button. The Menu list 
will appear in the TFT display.
6.	 Rotate the MULT knob to find the “EQ” Menu area, 
containing Menu items “119” through “127”; these 
parameters apply to the adjustment of the Parametric 
Microphone Equalizer when the speech processor 
is disabled. Menu items “128” through “136” ap-
ply to the adjustment of the Parametric Microphone 
Equalizer when the speech processor is engaged.

the microphone while listening to the effect of the 
changes you are making. Because the overall ef-
fect on the sound will change with each adjustment, 
make several passes through each adjustment area, 
to be sure that you achieve the optimum settings.
9.	 When all adjustments have been completed, touch 
[ENTER] on the LCD to save the new settings. 
10.	Press the MENU(SETUP) button or touch [BACK] 
on the LCD to return to normal operation. If you

Advice:
To roll off the excessive bass response prevalent in a 
wide-range of studio microphones, try setting the micro-
phone equalizer for a 10 dB null at 100 Hz with a band-
width of “1” or “2”, a 3 dB null centered on 800 Hz with 
a bandwidth of “3”, and then put an 8 dB peak centered 
on 2100 Hz with a bandwidth of “1.” These are starting 
recommendations; each microphone and user’s voice 
will be different, often requiring different settings.

Enhancing Transmit Signal Quality
Using the Speech Processor (SSB Mode)
The FT-991A Speech Processor is designed to increase “talk power” by increasing the average power output (via a so-
phisticated compression technique) and adjusting the audio quality to the menu settings (“128 P-PRMTRC EQ1 FREQ”, 
“131 P-PRMTRC EQ2 FREQ”, “134 P-PRMTRC EQ3 FREQ”). The result is improved intelligibility when conditions 
are difficult.
1.	 Adjust [MIC GAIN] on the TFT display, as described 
on page 61.
2.	 Touch [METER] on the TFT display to select 
“COMP” (Compression) meter.
MULTI Knob

3.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [PROC] to 
display the PROC level (from 1 to 100), confirming 
that the Speech Processor is engaged.
4.	 Press the PTT switch on the microphone, and speak 
into the microphone in a normal voice level.
5.	 Adjust the MULT knob to set the compression level 
within the 5 dB to 10 dB range.
6.	 To switch the Speech Processor off, touch [PROC] 
on the TFT display once more. The “OFF” will ap-
pear in the display, confirming that the Speech pro-
cessor is turned off.
Advice:
	 You may adjust the Parametric Microphone Equal-
izer when the speech processor is engaged, using 
Menu Items “128” through “136”. See page 139 
for details.

FT-991  Operating Manual
Enhancing Transmit Signal Quality
Adjusting the SSB Transmitted Bandwidth (SSB Mode)
For SSB transmission, a default bandwidth of 2.4 kHz is available. This bandwidth provides reasonable fidelity along 
with good talk power, and is the typical bandwidth used for decades for SSB transmission. The transmit bandwidth may 
be varied by the operator, to provide different levels of fidelity or talk power, according to individual preferences. 
Here are the steps to adjust the SSB transmit bandwidth:
1.	 Press the MENU(SETUP) button to engage the 
Menu.
2.	 Rotate the MULTI knob to select Menu item “110 
SSB TX BPF”.
3.	 Touch [SELECT] on the TFT display, then rotate 
the MULTI knob to select the desired bandwidth. 
The available selections are: 100-3000 Hz, 100-
2900 Hz, 200-2800 Hz, 300-2700 Hz, 400-2600 Hz. 
The default is 300-2700 Hz. A wider bandwidth will 
provide greater fidelity.  A narrow bandwidth will 
compress the available transmitter power into less 
spectrum, resulting in more “talk power” for DX 
pile-ups.

5.	 Press the MENU(SETUP) button or touch [BACK] 
on the TFT display to exit to normal operation.
Advice:
The Transmit Monitor function is a very helpful way to 
confirm the effect that changing the bandwidth will have 
on fidelity. To activate the Monitor function, press the 
F(MLIST) button to reveal the functions list on the TFT 
LCD display. Then touch the [MONI] button, you will 
be able to hear the difference in sound quality as you 
make bandwidth changes.
Quick Points:
The higher fidelity associated with wide bandwidth will 
be particularly enjoyable on the low bands during local 
rag-chew QSOs.

5.	 Press the MENU(SETUP) button or touch [BACK] 
on the LCD to exit to normal operation.
6.	 Press the CLAR button. The “TX” icon will appear 
in the TFT display.
Quick Point:
	
The Clarifier is frequently used for receiver offset 
tuning. However, for DX pile-ups where the DX 
station is using a split of less than 10 kHz, the TX 
Clarifier function is usually the quickest way to set 
the transmitter to the desired offset frequency.
7.	 Rotate the CLAR/VFO-B knob to set the desired 
transmitter offset. A maximum split of ±9.999 kHz 
may be set.
8.	 To exit from TX Clarifier operation, press the CLAR 
button once more. The “TX” icon will disappear 
from the display.
Advice:
	 When listening to a “pile-up” calling a DX station, in 
order to find the station currently being worked, you 
may press the CLAR button. Then, use the CLAR/
VFO-B knob to zero in on the station calling the DX 
(use the SPOT function on CW for precise alignment 
of your frequency). You may then press the CLAR 
button again to cancel the RX Clarifier, and return to 
reception on the DX station’s frequency.
	 Just as with receiver Clarifier operation, the amount 
of offset from the original VFO frequency will ap-
pear in the display.
	 As with receiver Clarifier operation, when you turn 
the TX Clarifier off, the last-used offset is remem-
bered, and will be available if you turn the TX Clari-
fier back on. To clear the Clarifier offset, press and 
hold the CLAR button for more than 1 second.
Quick Point:
When attempting to work a DX station on CW in a split 
frequency pile-up, remember that a large number of 
other stations may also be using Yaesu transceivers with 
capability similar to that of your FT-991A. On the DX 
side of the pile-up, everyone calling precisely on the 
same CW frequency will sound like a single tone! So 
you may have more success if you use the RX Clarifier 
to find a hole in the pile-up, instead of trying to zero-
beat the last station worked by the DX station.

VFO-B RX Indicator: “OFF” (LED Off)
	
VFO-B TX Indicator: “ON” (LED glows Red)
SPLIT Button
TXW Button
A/B Button
During Split operation, the VFO-A  register will be used 
for reception, while the VFO-B register will be used for 
transmission. If you press the SPLIT button once more, 
Split operation will be cancelled.
Advice:
	 During Split operation, pressing the A/ B button will 
reverse the contents of VFO-A and VFO-B. Press the 
A/B button once more to return to the original fre-
quency alignment.
	 During Split operation you may listen to the TX fre-
quency temporarily while pressing the TXW button 
located on the bottom left of the Main Tuning Dial 
knob.
	
While pressing the TXW button during split opera-
tions, the frequency of transmit on VFO-B can be 
changed.
	 During Split operation it is also possible to set VFO-
A and VFO-B to different Amateur bands if a multi 
band antenna is used.
Quick Split Operation
The Quick Split feature allows setting a one-touch offset 
of +5 kHz compared to the VFO-A frequency, to be ap-
plied to the transceiver VFO-B (transmit) frequency,
1.	 Start with regular transceiver operation on the VFO-A.
	
VFO-A RX Indicator: “ON” (LED glows Green)
	
VFO-A TX Indicator: “ON” (LED glows Red)
	
VFO-B RX Indicator: “OFF” (LED Off)
	
VFO-B TX Indicator: “OFF” (LED Off)
2.	 Press and hold in the SPLIT button for one second 
to engage the Quick Split feature, and apply a fre-
quency 5 kHz above the VFO-A frequency to the 
VFO-B frequency register.
	
The VFO configuration will then be:
	
VFO-A RX Indicator: “ON” (LED glows Green)
	
VFO-A TX Indicator: “OFF” (LED Off)
	
VFO-B RX Indicator: “OFF” (LED Off)
	
VFO-B TX Indicator: “ON” (LED glows Red)
3.	 Press and hold in the SPLIT switch for one second 
to increment the Sub (VFO-B) offset frequency an-
other +5 kHz.
Quick Points:
	 The offset of  VFO-B from VFO-A is programmed 
via the Menu and is set to +5 kHz at the factory. 
However, other offsets may be selected using the fol-
lowing procedure:

Setup for Straight Key (and Straight Key emulation) Operation
Before starting, connect your key line(s) to the front panel KEY jack. Be sure [BK-IN] displayed by pressing the F(M-
LIST) button is turned off for now.
1.	 Press the MODE button, then touch [CW-LSB] or 
[CW-USB] on the TFT LCD display. The “C-L” 
or “C-U” icon will appear in the display. The CW 
monitor is activated.

2.	 Rotate the Main Tuning Dial knob to select the de-
sired operating frequency.
3.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [BK-IN] 
on the LCD to engage automatic activation of the 
transmitter when you close the CW key. The Break-
in will be set to “ON”.
Advice:
	 When you close the CW key, the transmitter will 
automatically be activated, and the CW carrier 
will be transmitted. When you release the key, 
transmission will cease, and after a brief delay, 
receive will be restored. The delay time is user-
programmable per the discussion on page 85.
	 As shipped from the factory, the FT-991A TX/
RX system for CW is configured for “Semi-
break-in” operation. However, using Menu item 
“056 CW BK-IN TYPE”, you may change this 
setup for full break-in (QSK) operation, whereby 
the switching is quick enough to hear incoming 
signals in the spaces between the dots and dashes 
of your transmission. This may prove very useful 
during contest and traffic handling operations.
4.	 CW operation using the CW key may now proceed.
Advice:
	 The CW sidetone audio level may be adjusted by 
setting “MONITOR” (see page 74).
	 You may practice sending CW listening to the sidet-
one only, without having the signal transmitted out 
over the air, if you press the front panel F(M-LIST) 
button to reveal the functions list on the TFT LCD 
display, and then touch the [BK-IN] button to set 
break-in to Off.
	 If you reduce transmit power via the [RF PWR] 
function that may be displayed by pressing the F(M-
LIST) button, the ALC meter reading will increase; 
this is normal and does not indicate any problem 
whatsoever (because increased ALC voltage is being 
used to lower the power).
	 To enable the keying operation in LSB/USB mode 
and send the CW signal without switching to CW 
mode, change Menu item “055 CW AUTO MODE”.
	 The same frequency may be displayed when switch-
ing between SSB mode and CW mode by setting 
Menu item “059 CW FREQ DISPLAY”.
	 By connecting the FT-991A to a computer, CW can 
be operated using free or commercially available 
software and setting Menu item “060 PC KEYING”.

Page 79
FT-991  Operating Manual
CW Mode Operation
Terminology:
	
Semi-break-in
This is a pseudo-”VOX” mode used on CW, whereby the closure of the CW key will engage the transmitter, and 
release of the key will allow the receiver to recover after a short delay. No signals will be heard during the spaces 
between dots and dashes (unless the sending speed is extremely slow).
	
Full break-in
Full break-in (also known as “Full QSK”) involves very fast switching between transmit and receive, incoming 
signals may be heard between the dots and dashes as you send them. This allows you to hear a station that sud-
denly starts transmitting on your frequency, while you are in the midst of a transmission.

in Electronic Keyer is now active.
4.	 Touch [SPEED] on the LCD, then rotate the MULTI 
knob to set the desired sending speed (4 - 60 WPM). 
Advice:
	 Rotate the MULTI knob to display the keying 
speed (4 - 60 WPM) below the [SPEED] indica-
tor.
	 By pressing either the “Dot” or “Dash” side of 
the paddle, the CW keying tone will automati-
cally be generated.
5.	 Touch [BK-IN] on the TFT display to engage auto-
matic activation of the transmitter when either the 
“Dot” or “Dash” side of the paddle is pressed. The 
Break-in will be set to “ON”.
6.	 CW operation utilizing the CW paddle may now 
commence.
Advice:
	 When the keyer paddle is pressed, the transmitter 
will automatically be activated, and the CW charac-
ters (or a string of dots or dashes) will be transmit-
ted. When the keyer paddle is released, transmission 
will cease, and after a brief delay, reception will be 
restored. The delay time is user-programmable, per 
the discussion on page 85.
	 The CW sidetone audio level may be set using 
“MONITOR” (see page 74).
	 If [BK-IN] is set to “OFF”, you may practice sending 
CW with the sidetone only, without having the signal 
go out over the air. (Press the front panel F(M-LIST) 
button to reveal the functions list on the TFT display ).
	 If the transmitter power is reduced via [RF PWR] 
function, the ALC meter reading will increase; this 
is normal and does not indicate any problem whatso-
ever (because increased ALC voltage is being used 
to lower the power).
	 The keying operation may also be enabled in LSB/
USB mode to send the CW signal via the Menu item 
“055 CW AUTO MODE” without switching to CW

Selecting the Keyer Operating Mode
The configuration of the Electronic Keyer may be customized independently for the front panel KEY jack of the 
FT-991A. This permits utilization of Automatic Character Spacing (ACS), if desired. This allows the use of an 
electronic keyer via the front jack and a straight key or computer-driven keying line via the rear panel jack.
1.	 Press the MENU(SETUP) button to engage the 
Menu.
2.	 Rotate the MULTI knob to select Menu item “012 
KEYER TYPE”.
3.	 Press the [SELECT] button, and then rotate the 
MULTI knob to set the keyer to the desired mode. 
The available selections are:
OFF:	
The built-in Electronic Keyer is 
turned off (“straight key” mode).
BUG:	
Dots will be generated automatically 
by the keyer, but dashes must be sent 
manually.
ELEKEY-A:	A code element (“Dot” or “Dash” 
side) is transmitted upon releasing 
both sides of the paddle.
ELEKEY-B:	Releasing both sides of the paddle 
transmits the currently generated 
“Dash” side followed by “Dot” side 
(or reverse order).
ELEKEY-Y:	Pressing both sides of the paddle 
transmits the currently generated 
“Dash” side followed by “Dot” side 
(or reverse order).
	
While transmitting the “Dash” side, 
the first transmitted “Dot” side will 
not be stored.
ACS:	
Same as “ELEKEY” except that the 
spacing between characters is pre-
cisely set by the keyer to be the same 
length as a dash (three dots in length).

CW Spotting (Zero-Beating)
“Spotting” (zeroing in on a received CW station) is a handy technique to ensure you and the other station are precisely 
on the same frequency.
The Tuning Offset Indicator in the display may also be observed so you can adjust the receiver frequency to center the 
incoming station on the pitch corresponding to that of your transmitted signal.
Using the Auto Zeroing System
Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [ZIN] on the 
LCD to cause the receiving frequency to zero-in auto-
matically while receiving the CW signal.
F(M-LIST) Button
Using the SPOT System
1.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button to display the function 
list.
2.	 Touch [MONI] on the LCD. The Monitor function 
will be set to “ON”. The MULTI knob will function 
as the MONITOR adjustment knob.
F(M-LIST) Button
MONI (Monitor) indicator
MONI (Monitor) level indicator
3.	 Touch [SPOT] on the LCD. While you are press-
ing and holding [SPOT], the tone is output from the 
speaker.
Advice:
	 In a tough DX pile-up, you may actually want to 
use the SPOT system to find a “gap” in the spread 
of calling stations, instead of zeroing in precisely 
on the last station being worked by the DX station. 
From the DX side, if a dozen or more operators (also 
using Yaesu’s SPOT system) all call precisely on the 
same frequency, their dots and dashes merge into a 
single, long tone that the DX station cannot decipher. 
In such situations, calling slightly higher or lower in 
frequency may get your call through.
Quick Points:
	 The displayed frequency on CW normally reflects 
the “zero beat” frequency of your offset carrier. That 
is, if you were to listen on USB on 14.100.00 MHz 
to a signal with a 700 Hz offset, the “zero beat” fre-
quency of that CW carrier would be 14.100.70 MHz; 
the latter frequency is what the FT-991A displays, 
by default. However, you can change the display to 
be identical to what you would see on SSB by using 
Menu item “059 CW FREQ DISPLAY” and setting 
it to “DIRECT FREQ” instead of the default “PITCH 
OFFSET” setting.

CW Delay Time Setting
During semi-break-in (not QSK) operation, the hang time of the transmitter, after you have finished sending, may be ad-
justed to a comfortable value consistent with your sending speed. This is the functional equivalent of the “VOX Delay” 
adjustment used on voice modes, and the delay may be varied anywhere between 30 msec and 3 seconds via Menu item 
“057 CW BK-IN DELAY”.
1.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button to display the function

CW Pitch Adjustment
The center frequency of the receiver passband may be adjusted to the CW tone you prefer. By touching [PITCH] on the 
LCD, the pitch of the CW offset carrier may be varied between 300 Hz and 1050 Hz, in 10 Hz steps.
1.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button to display the function 
list, then touch [PITCH] on the LCD. The MULTI 
knob functions as the PITCH adjustment knob.
2.	 Rotate the MULTI knob to adjust the PITCH (300 
Hz to 1,050 Hz). 
Terminology:
CW Pitch: If the receiver is tuned to an exact “zero 
beat” on an incoming CW signal, you could not copy 
it (“Zero beat” implies a 0 Hz tone). Therefore, the re-
ceiver is offset several hundreds of Hz (typically), to 
produce a beat tone that can be heard. The BFO offset 
associated with this tuning (that produces the comfort-
able audio tone) is called the CW Pitch.

Transmitting in the Beacon Mode
In “Beacon” mode, it is possible to repeatedly 
transmit any message programmed, either via 
paddle input, or via the “Text” input method. The 
time delay between message repeats may be set 
anywhere between 1 and 690 seconds (1 - 240 
sec (1 sec/step) or 270 - 690 sec (30 sec/step)) 
via Menu item “015 BEACON INTERVAL” If you 
do not wish the message to repeat in a “Beacon” 
mode, please set this Menu item to “OFF”.
To transmit the message:
1.	 Touch [BK-IN] on the LCD to enable trans-
mission. Either Full-break-in or Semi-break-
in will be engaged, depending on the setting 
of Menu item “056 CW BK-IN TYPE”.
2.	 Touch [CH1] - [CH5] on the LCD or press an 
FH-2 [1] - [5] key. Repetitive transmission of 
the Beacon message will begin.
Decrementing the Contest Number
Use this process if the current contest number 
gets slightly ahead of the actual number you 
want to send (in case of a duplicate QSO, for ex-
ample).
Press the FH-2 [DEC] key or touch [DEC/DEL] 
on the LCD momentarily. The current Contest 
Number will be reduced by one. Press of the 
FH-2 [DEC] key or touch [DEC/DEL] on the 
LCD as many times as necessary to reach the de-
sired number. If you go too far, use the “Contest 
Number Programming” technique described pre-
viously.

Advice:
	 The conventional repeater shift used on 29 MHz is 
100 kHz, while on the 50 MHz band the shift may 
vary between 500 kHz and 1.7 MHz (or more). On 
the 144 MHz band, the shift will be 600 kHz; on 
the 430 MHz band, the shift will be 1.6 MHz or 7.6 
MHz (5 MHz for the U.S.A. version). To program 
the proper repeater shift, use Menu items “080 
RPT SHIFT 28MHz” (28 MHz), “081 RPT SHIFT 
50MHz” (50 MHz), “082 RPT SHIFT 144MHz” 
(144 MHz), and “083 RPT SHIFT 430MHz” (430 
MHz) as appropriate.
	 Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [REV] on 
the LCD to reverse the transmission and reception 
frequencies temporarily to check whether direct 
communication with the partner station is possible.

tween V/D mode and FR mode (see “Toggling to the 
Digital Communication Mode” on page 41).
	 The AMS (Automatic Mode Select) function enables 
the transceiver to select the appropriate communica-
tion mode according to the received signal. Using 
the AMS function, the transceiver recognizes either 
analog (FM) or C4FM digital signals and automati-
cally changes to the same communication mode as 
the contact station.
Note:
	 When communicating in V/D mode (“DN” is dis-
played on the LCD), the station location information 
is contained within the transmitted digital signal. In 
Voice FR mode (“VW” is displayed on the LCD), the 
location information is not included in the transmit-
ted signals.

DG-ID/DP-ID Features
Digital Group ID (DG-ID) feature
The DG-ID function can set up two-digit DG-ID numbers from “00” to “99” separately for Transmit and Receive.  By 
setting both transmit and receive to “00” (default), you can communicate with all the other stations in the digital C4FM 
mode.By matching the transmit DG-ID number to the uplink DG-ID number set in club the DR-2X/XE System Fusion 
II digital repeater, you can access the digital repeater DR-2X/XE used in the club. For communication only among a 
group of friend’s transceivers, you can all match the same DG-ID number; then only your friend’s voices will be heard. 
Also, by using the GM function you can check whether stations with the same DG-ID are in the communication range.
The FT-991A may register transmit and receive DG-ID numbers in the DG-ID memories (up to 10 pairs).
Register the DG-ID number in the DG-ID memory
Example: Enter the transmit DG-ID number “50” and the receive DG-ID number “50” into the DG-ID memory “01”.

Every C4FM digital transmit communication contains the individual ID information (Radio ID) of each transceiver. 
The DP-ID function uses this individual ID information. By registering the DP-ID of the transceiver to the DR-2X 
System Fusion II digital repeater,   the digital repeater may be controlled by remote operation. When the DP-IDs of the 
transceiver are registered with each other, they can communicate even if the DG-ID numbers are different.
Registering the DP-ID to a DR-2X digital repeater
After registering the transceiver’s DP-ID to the DR-2X repeater, the settings and functions of the DR-2X can be 
remotely controlled. Remote control cannot be performed from a transceiver that has not been registered with the DP-
ID, so it is possible to securely manage repeaters.
Note:
	 To register the transceiver DP-ID in the DR-2X C4FM digital repeater, refer to the DR-2X instruction manual.
DR-2X Remote Control Feature
To display the remote-control screen of the FT-991A, touch and hold [AMS] on the LCD in C4FM digital mode. To 
return to normal mode, touch [BACK] on the LCD. For details on the remote-control function of the DR-2X, refer to 
the DR-2X instruction manual.

Convenient Memory functions
The FT-991A contains ninety-nine regular memories, labeled “01” through “99”, nine special programmed band edge 
memory pairs, labeled “P-1L/P-1U” through “P-9L/P-9U”, and five QMB (Quick Memory Bank) memories. Each mem-
ory stores various settings, in addition to the VFO-A frequency and mode, but also stores the various settings shown be-
low. By default, the 99 regular memories are contained in one group; however, they can be arranged in up to six separate 
groups, if desired.
Quick Point:
The FT-991A memory channels store the following 
data (not just the operating frequency):
	 VFO-A Frequency
	 VFO-A Mode
	 Clarifier status and its Offset Frequency
	 IPO status
	 Attenuator status
	 Noise Blanker status
	 IF SHIFT and WIDTH status
	 CONTOUR status and its Peak Frequency
	 DSP Noise Reduction (DNR) status and its 
Reduction algorithm selection.
	 DSP Notch filter (NOTCH) status
	 NAR bandwidth status
	 DSP Auto Notch filter (DNF) status
	 Repeater Shift Direction
	 CTCSS Tone information (CTCSS Encode, 
Decode ON/OFF; Tone Frequency)

QMB (Quick Memory Bank)
The Quick Memory Bank consists of five memories independent from the regular and PMS memories. The QMB mem-
ories can quickly store operating parameters for later recall. 
QMB Channel Storage
1.	 Tune to the desired frequency on VFO-A.
2.	 Press and hold the RCL/STO button for one second. 
The “beep” will confirm that the VFO-A contents 
have been written to the currently available QMB 
memory.
Repeated one second presses of the RCL/STO but-
ton will write the VFO-A contents to successive QMB 
memories.
Once all five QMB memories have data on them, previ-
ous data will be over-written on a first-in, first-out basis.
QMB Channel Recall
1.	 Press the RCL/STO button briefly. The current 
QMB channel data will be shown on the frequency 
display area. The “QMB” icon will also appear and 
the Memory Mode indicators in the LED indicators 
area will illuminate.
2.	 Repeated brief presses of the RCL/STO button will 
toggle through the QMB channels.
3.	 Press the V/M button to return to the VFO or Memo-
ry mode.

Advice:
Rotating the Main Tuning Dial knob, or changing the 
operating mode, will place the transceiver in the “Mem-
ory Tune” mode, which is a temporary “pseudo-VFO” 
method of tuning off of a stored memory channel. If you 
do not over-write the contents of the current memory 
channel, the original contents will not be disturbed by 
the initiation of Memory Tune operation.

originally memorized frequency of the current mem-
ory channel. One more press of the V/M button will 
return to VFO operation.
Note:
Computer software programs utilizing the CAT system 
interface port may presume that the transceiver is oper-
ating in the VFO mode, for certain features like “band 
mapping” and/or frequency logging, because the “Mem-
ory Tune” mode so closely resembles the VFO mode. Be 
sure that you have the FT-991A operating in a control 
mode compatible with the software’s requirements. Use 
the VFO mode if you’re not sure.

VFO Scanning
Either the VFO or the memory channels of the FT-991A may be scanned, and the receiver will halt scanning on any 
frequency with a signal strong enough to open the receiver squelch.
1.	 Set the VFO-A to the frequency on which you would 
like to begin scanning.
2.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [SQL] on 
the LCD. Rotate the MULTI knob so that the back-
ground noise is just silenced.
F(M-LIST) Button
MULTI Knob
3.	 Press and hold in the microphone UP or DWN but-
ton for one second, or press the F(M-LIST) button 
followed by [SCAN] to start scanning in the speci-
fied direction on the VFO frequency.
4.	 If the scanner halts on an incoming signal, the deci-
mal point between the “MHz” and “kHz” digits of 
the frequency display will blink.
Advice:
	 If the incoming signal disappears, scanning will 
resume in about five seconds.
	 On the SSB/CW and SSB-based Data modes, the 
scanner will pause on a received signal, then will 
step across the signal very slowly, giving you 
time to stop the scan, if you like. In these modes 
on the VFO, the scanner does not stop, however.
5.	 To cancel scanning, press the PTT switch, or touch 
[SCAN] on the LCD.
Advice:
	 If the scan has paused on a signal, pressing the mi-
crophone UP or DWN button, or touching [SCAN] 
on the LCD will cause scanning to resume instantly.
	 If you press the microphone PTT button during 
scanning, the scanner will halt at once. However, 
pressing the PTT button during scanning will not 
cause transmission.
	 The manner in which the scanner resumes after it has 
paused on a signal may be selected by using Menu 
item “038 MIC SCAN RESUME”. The default “TIME” 
(5 sec) setting will cause the scanner to resume scan-
ning after five seconds; however the scan setting 
may be changed to resume only after the received 
signal has dropped out.
	 If the Main Tuning Dial knob is rotated while scan-
ning is in progress, the scanning will continue up 
or down in frequency according to the direction of 
the Dial Knob rotation. (in other words, if the dial 
is rotated to the left when scanning toward a higher 
frequency, the direction of the scan will reverse.)
Quick Point:
If you have no interest in scanning, and wish to prohibit 
the microphone UP/DWN buttons from initiating scan-
ning, you may disable scanning control from the mi-
crophone using Menu item “037 MIC SCAN” (set it to

3.	 Press and hold in the microphone UP or DWN but-
ton for one second, or press the F(M-LIST) button 
followed by [SCAN] to start scanning in the speci-
fied direction.
Advice:
	 If the scanner halts on an incoming signal, the 
decimal point between the “MHz” and “kHz” 
digits of the frequency display will blink.
	 If the incoming signal disappears, scanning will 
resume in about five seconds.
4.	 To cancel scanning, press the PTT switch, or touch 
[SCAN] on the LCD.
Advice:
	 During Memory Group operation, only the channels 
within the current Memory Group will be scanned.
	 If the scan has paused on a signal, pressing the mi-
crophone UP or DWN button, or touching [SCAN] 
on the LCD will cause scanning to resume instantly.
	 If you press the microphone PTT button during 
scanning, the scanner will halt at once. However, 
pressing the PTT button during scanning will not 
cause transmission.
	 The manner in which the scanner resumes after it has 
paused on a signal may be selected by using Menu 
item “038 MIC SCAN RESUME”. During memory 
scanning, the default “TIME” (5 sec) setting will 
cause the scanner to resume scanning after five sec-
onds; however the scan may be set, to resume only 
after the received signal has dropped out.
	 If the Main Tuning Dial knob is rotated while scan-
ning is in progress, the memory channel scanning 
will continue up or down in accordance with the di-
rection of the Dial Knob rotation. (In other words, if 
the dial is rotated to the left when scanning toward a 
higher channel number, the direction of the scan will 
reverse.)
Quick Point:
If you have no interest in scanning, and wish to prohibit 
the microphone UP/DWN buttons from initiating scan-
ning, you may disable scanning control from the mi-
crophone using Menu item “037 MIC SCAN” (set it to 
“DISABLE”).

PMS (Programmable Memory Scanning)
To limit scanning (and manual tuning) within a particular frequency range, the Programmable Memory Scanning (PMS) 
feature utilizes nine special-purpose memory pairs (“P-1L/P-1U” through “P-9L/P-9U”). The PMS feature is especially 
useful in helping you to observe any operating sub-band limits, which apply to your Amateur license class.
1.	 Store the Lower and Upper tuning/scanning limit 
frequencies into the memory pair “P-1L” and “P-1U”, 
respectively, or any other “L/U” pair of memories 
in the special PMS memory area. See page 104 for 
details regarding memory storage.
2.	 Press the V/M button to enter the “Memory” mode.
3.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [MCH] on 
the TFT display. The LEDs indicating the Memory 
mode will illuminate.
V/M Button
MULTI Knob

4.	 Rotate the MULTI knob to select memory channel 
“P-1L” or “P-1U”.
5.	 Press the F(M-LIST) button, then touch [SQL] on 
the LCD. Rotate the MULTI knob so that the back-
ground noise is just silenced.
6.	 Turn the Main Tuning Dial knob slightly (to activate 
memory tuning). Tuning and scanning are now lim-
ited to the range within the P-1L/P-1U limits until 
the V/M button is pressed again to return to memory 
channel or VFO operation.
7.	 Press and hold in the microphone UP or DWN but-
ton for one second, or press the F(M-LIST) button 
followed by [SCAN] to start scanning in the speci-
fied direction.
Advice:
	 If the scanner halts on an incoming signal, the deci-
mal point between the “MHz” and “kHz” digits of 
the frequency display will blink.
	 If the incoming signal disappears, scanning will re-
sume in about five seconds.
	 On the SSB/CW and SSB-based Data modes, the 
scanner will pause on a received signal, then will 
step across the signal very slowly, giving you time to 
stop the scan, if you like. However, in these modes 
on the VFO, the scanner does not stop.
	 If the scan has paused on a signal, pressing the mi-
crophone UP or DWN button, or touching [SCAN] 
on the LCD will cause scanning to resume instantly.
	 If the Main Tuning Dial knob is rotated while scan-
ning is in progress, the scanning will continue up 
or down in frequency according to the direction of 
the Dial Knob rotation. (in other words, if the dial 
is rotated to the left when scanning toward a higher 
frequency, the direction of the scan will reverse.)
	 If the microphone PTT button is pressed during 
scanning, the scanner will halt at once. Pressing the 
PTT button during scanning will not cause transmis-
sion.

FT-991  Operating Manual
Connecting a YAESU FT5DR/E, FTM-300DR/E or a commercially available GPS receiver/antenna to the FT-991A 
will permit the transceiver to constantly receive and display the station location information.
By utilizing the GPS location information, you can register stations with which you frequently communicate and use the 
GM function to confirm whether they are within communication range.
What is GPS?
GPS or Global Positioning System is a satellite location 
system that is used to determine the current position on 
earth. It is a military system developed by the US De-
partment of Defense with approximately 30 GPS satel-
lites orbiting the earth at an altitude of about 20,000 km, 
When signals from three or more satellites in space are 
received, the current position information (longitude, 
latitude, altitude etc.) may be determined within an ac-
curacy of several meters. The accurate time can also be 
received from the atomic clock built into the GPS satel-
lite.
About GPS Positioning
Positioning refers to the calculation of one’s own position derived from the satellites orbit information and the 
transmission time of the radio waves. Positioning requires that three or more satellites be acquired. When posi-
tioning cannot be carried out properly, move to an open space as far away from buildings as possible and where 
there are fewer obstructions.
About the Error
Depending on the surrounding environment of the receiver location, an error of several hundred meters may oc-
cur. Although positioning is possible using only three satellites, depending on the positioning conditions, the po-
sitioning accuracy may become worse, or may no longer be possible under the following conditions:
	 Between high rise buildings, narrow roads between buildings, indoors and under the shade of buildings, be-
low high voltage lines and underneath overhead structures, between trees and shrubs such as in forests and 
woods, inside tunnels and underground, when used behind a solar-energy reflecting glass, locations where a 
strong magnetic field occurs
When not Using the Radio for a Long Period of Time
When using the GPS function for the first time after purchasing the FT-991A transceiver, and when turning it on 
after It has not been used for a long period time, positioning may take several minutes in order to search for the 
satellites. Also, when using the device again several hours after switching off the power, positioning may take 
several minutes in order to search for the satellites.
Positioning Using GPS
1.	 Press and hold in the front panel ON/OFF switch to 
turn the transceiver on.
	
The satellite search will begin and the “
” icon will 
be displayed at the top right of the screen.
Advice:
	 It may take several minutes to acquire the satel-
lites.
	 When three or more satellites cannot be acquired, 
the icon display will disappear. In this case, posi-
tioning is not possible and the position informa-
tion cannot be used.

FC-40 External Automatic Antenna Tuner (for Wire Antenna)
The FC-40 makes use of the control circuitry built into the transceiver, which allows the operator to control and monitor 
automatic operation of the FC-40, which mounts near the antenna feedpoint. The FC-40 uses specially selected, 
thermally stable components, and is housed in a waterproof case to withstand severe environmental conditions with high 
reliability.
A carefully-chosen combination of solid-state switching components and high-speed relays allows the FC-40 to match 
a wide variety of antennas to within a 2:1 SWR on any amateur band frequency (160 through 6 meters), typically in less 
than eight seconds. Transmitter power required for matching may be as little as 4 - 60 Watts, and matching settings are 
automatically stored in memory for instant recall when the same frequency range is selected later.
Please see the FC-40 Operating Manual for detailed information.
Interconnections to FT-991A
After mounting the FC-40, connect the cables from the 
FC-40 to the ANT and TUNER jacks on the rear panel 
of the FT-991A Transceiver.

sure you are not interfering with others who may 
already be using the frequency.
r	 It is normal to hear the sound of the relays while 
tuning is in progress.
r	 If the impedance cannot be matched by the FC-40 
better than 2:1, and the “HI-SWR” icon blinks, the 
microprocessor will not retain the tuning data for that

Active-Tuning Antenna System (ATAS-120A) Operation
ATAS-120A is a multi-band auto-tuning antenna that can be used in the amateur bands from the HF band to the UHF 
band (7/14/21/28(29) /50/144/430)
Using the active tuning mechanism, tuning can be carried out automatically by the control signal from FT-991A. Please 
refer to the ATAS-120A Operating Manual for the assembly and installation of ATAS-120A.
Interconnections to FT-991A
Connect “ATAS-120A” to the ANT terminal of FT-991A with a coaxial cable as shown in the diagram below.
Advice:
	 Turn off the external power supply switch and 
the FT-991A power supply switch first before 
connecting the cables.
	 Grounding is required for the ATAS-120A. Make 
sure the antenna base is in contact with the car body 
to ensure proper grounding.
Note:
	 Do not plug or unplug the connector of the antenna 
cable with wet hands. Do not plug or unplug the 
connector during transmission as well. This may 
result in electric shock, injury, etc.
	 The unit cannot be used with both the antenna tuner 
and ATAS-120A connected.
When using an antenna duplexer, the ANT terminal of 
the ATAS-120A and the HF/50 MHz ANT terminal 
of the FT-991A must be connected in series and also 
insulated from the grounding in order to supply the 
control voltage for the ATAS-120A.
When installing a dedicated VHF/UHF antenna si-
multaneously with the ATAS-120A, use a VHF/UHF 
antenna that does not include the HF - 50 MHz bands 
(144/430 MHz type).
The reception circuit of the V/UHF band may be im-
pacted by the transmitter energy from the ATAS-120A.
In addition, install the 2 antennas as far away from each 
other as possible.

To install the MMB-90, before commencing work, first 
use the following points as a guide to find a suitable 
installation location that will allow the transceiver to be 
easily operated.
	 Please choose a location that will not affect the op-
eration of the air bag system for cars equipped with 
air bags.
	 That will not obstruct the field of view in front.
	 That will not impede driving.
	 That will not result in danger to the passengers in the 
assistant driver’s seat and rear seats etc.
	 That is not exposed to direct sunlight and hot air etc.
	 That is well-ventilated.
Select a flat mounting surface. If the mounting surface 
is not flat, the bracket may be distorted, resulting in the 
inability to mount the transceiver.
Be sure to use screws of the specified size to install each 
part according to the specified method. Malfunctions 
will result if screws of the wrong sizes are used, or if the 
unit is mounted wrongly.
Stay (user prepared)
Mounting Bracket MMB-90 Installation
The viewing angle of the transceiver may be 
adjusted by changing the location of the front 
mounting screws.
