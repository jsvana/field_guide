PRECAUTIONS
R DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE! NEVER touch an an-
tenna or internal antenna connector during transmission. This 
may result in an electrical shock or burn.
R WARNING RF EXPOSURE! This device emits 
Radio Frequency (RF) energy. Extreme caution should 
be observed when operating this device. If you have 
any questions regarding RF exposure and safety stan-
dards please refer to the Federal Communications 
Commission Office of Engineering and Technology’s 
report on Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines 
for Human Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields 
(OET Bulletin 65).
R WARNING! NEVER operate the transceiver while 
driving a vehicle. Safe driving requires your full attention—
anything less may result in an accident.
R WARNING! NEVER operate the transceiver with 
an earphone, headphones or other audio accessories 
at high volume levels. Hearing experts advise against 
continuous high volume operation. If you experience a 
ringing in your ears, reduce the volume level or discon-
tinue use.
R WARNING! NEVER apply AC power to the [DC13.8V] 
connector on the transceiver rear panel. This could cause a 
fire or damage the transceiver.
R WARNING! NEVER apply more than 16 V DC to the 
[DC13.8V] connector on the transceiver rear panel or use re-
verse polarity. This could cause a fire or damage the trans-
ceiver.
R WARNING! NEVER cut the DC power cable between 
the DC plug and fuse holder. If an incorrect connection is 
made after cutting, the transceiver might be damaged.
R WARNING! NEVER let metal, wire or other objects 
touch any internal part or connectors on the rear panel of the 
transceiver. This may result in an electric shock or this could 
cause a fire or damage the transceiver.
R WARNING! NEVER operate or touch the trans-
ceiver with wet hands. This may result in an electric 
shock or may damage the transceiver.
R WARNING! Immediately turn the transceiver power 
OFF and remove the power cable if it emits an abnormal 
odor, sound or smoke. Contact your Icom dealer or dis-
tributor for advice.
CAUTION: NEVER expose the transceiver to rain, snow 
or any liquids.
CAUTION: NEVER change the internal settings of 
the transceiver. This may reduce transceiver perfor-
mance and/or damage to the transceiver. 
DO NOT operate the transceiver near unshielded elec-
trical blasting caps or in an explosive atmosphere.
DO NOT use harsh solvents such as benzine or al-
cohol to clean the transceiver, as they will damage the 
transceiver’s surfaces. If the transceiver becomes dusty 
or dirty, wipe it clean with a soft, dry cloth.
DO NOT use or place the transceiver in areas with tem-
peratures below –10°C (+14°F) or above +60°C (+140°F). Be 
aware that temperatures on a vehicle’s dashboard can ex-
ceed +80°C (+176°F), resulting in permanent damage to the 
transceiver if left there for extended periods.
DO NOT place the transceiver in excessively dusty environ-
ments or in direct sunlight.
DO NOT place the transceiver against walls or putting any-
thing on top of the transceiver. This will obstruct heat dissipa-
tion.
Place the transceiver in a secure place to avoid inadvertent 
use by children.
During mobile operation, NEVER place the transceiver 
where air bag deployment may be obstructed.
During mobile operation, DO NOT place the transceiver 
where hot or cold air blows directly onto it.
During mobile operation, DO NOT operate the transceiver 
without running the vehicle’s engine. When the transceiver’s 
power is ON and your vehicle’s engine is OFF, the vehicle’s 
battery will soon become exhausted.
Make sure the transceiver power is OFF before starting the 
vehicle engine. This will avoid possible damage to the trans-
ceiver by ignition voltage spikes.
During maritime mobile operation, keep the transceiver and 
microphone as far away as possible from the magnetic navi-
gation compass to prevent erroneous indications.
BE CAREFUL! The rear panel will become hot when op-
erating the transceiver continuously for long periods of time.
BE CAREFUL! If a linear amplifier is connected, set the 
transceiver’s RF output power to less than the linear ampli-
fier’s maximum input level, otherwise, the linear amplifier will 
be damaged.
Use Icom microphones only (supplied or optional). Other 
manufacturer’s microphones have different pin assignments, 
and connection to the IC-7100 may damage the transceiver.

INSTALLATION AND CONNECTIONS
2-2
Select a location for the transceiver that allows ad-
equate air circulation, free from extreme heat, cold, 
vibrations, away from TV sets, TV antenna elements, 
radios and other electromagnetic sources.
The base of the transceiver has adjustable feet for 
desktop use. Set the feet to one of two angles, to meet 
your operating preference.
Selecting a location
Grounding
To prevent electrical shock, television interference 
(TVI), broadcast interference (BCI) and other problems, 
ground the transceiver using the GROUND terminal on 
the rear panel.
For best results, connect a heaviest gauge wire or strap 
to a long ground rod. Make the distance between the 
[GND] terminal and ground as short as possible.
R WARNING! NEVER connect the [GND] ter-
minal to a gas or electric pipe, since the connection 
could cause an explosion or electric shock.
Antenna connection
For radio communications, the antenna is of critical im-
portance, along with output power and receiver sensi-
tivity. Select a well-matched 50 ø antenna and coaxial 
cable feedline. We recommend 1.5:1 or better of Voltage 
Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) on your operating bands. 
The transmission line should be a coaxial cable.
When using a single antenna (for the HF, 50/70 MHz 
bands), use the [ANT1] connector.
CAUTION: Protect your transceiver from lightning by 
using a lightning arrestor.

Antenna connection
Connect the cable from an HF, 50/70 MHz antenna to 
the [ANT 1] connector.
Connect the cable from a 144/430MHz antenna to 
the [ANT 2] connector.
Antenna SWR
Each antenna is tuned for a specified frequency 
range and the SWR usually increases outside the 
range. When the SWR is higher than approximately 
2.0:1, the transceiver automatically reduces the TX 
power to protect the final transistors. In that case, an 
antenna tuner is useful to match the transceiver and 
antenna. Low SWR allows full power for transmit-
ting. The IC-7100 has an SWR meter to continuously 
monitor the antenna SWR.

This function is convenient when you operate 3 operat-
ing modes on one frequency band.
For example, one register can be used for a CW fre-
quency, another for an SSB frequency and the other 
one for an RTTY frequency.
If a band key or [GENE] is touched for 1 second once, 
the last used frequency and operating mode are called 
up. When the key is touched for 1 second again, anoth-
er stored frequency and operating mode are called up.
See the table below for a list of the available frequency 
bands and their default frequency and mode settings.

Squelch and receive (RF) sensitivity
Adjusts the RF gain and squelch threshold level. The 
squelch removes noise output to the speaker when no 
signal is received (closed squelch).
• The squelch is particularly effective for AM and FM, but also 
works in other modes.
• The 12 to 1 o’clock position is recommended for the most 
effective use of the [RF/SQL]
(L) control.
• The [RF/SQL]
(L) control operates as only an RF gain 
control (Squelch is fixed open), or a squelch control (RF 
gain is fixed at maximum sensitivity) depending on the “RF/
SQL Control” option in the “Function” Set mode. (p. 6-5)

• Rotating counterclockwise from the maximum position re-
duces sensitivity.
• The S-meter indicates receive sensitivity.
While rotating the RF gain control, a faint noise may 
be heard. This comes from the DSP unit and does 
not indicate an equipment malfunction.
❍ Adjusting squelch (Removing non-signal noise)
Rotate [RF/SQL]
(L) clockwise when no signal is re-
ceived, until the noise just disappears.
• The TX/RX LED light goes out.
• Rotating [RF/SQL]

nal level needed to open the squelch.

D-STAR INTRODUCTION
4-5
• In the original D-STAR (Digital Smart Technologies for 
Amateur Radio) plan, JARL envisioned a system of 
repeaters grouped together into Zones.
• The D-STAR repeater enables you to call a HAM sta-
tion on another repeater through the internet.
• The transceiver can be operated in the digital voice 
mode, including low-speed data operation, for both 
transmit and receive.
D-STAR Introduction
The DR (D-STAR Repeater) mode is one mode you can 
use for D-STAR repeater operation. In this mode, you 
can select a preprogrammed repeater or frequency in 
“FROM” (the access repeater or simplex), and UR call 
sign in “TO” (destination), as shown to the right.
NOTE: If the repeater, set to “FROM” (Access Re-
peater) has no Gateway call sign, you cannot make 
a gateway call.

D-STAR INTRODUCTION
4-6
In the DR mode, the transceiver has three communica-
tion forms, as shown below.
• Local area call: To call through your local area (ac-
cess) repeater.
• Gateway call: To call through your local area (ac-
cess) repeater, repeater gateway and 
the internet to your destination re-
peater or individual station’s last used 
repeater, using call sign routing.
• Simplex call: 
To call another station not using a re-
peater.
NOTE:
• Programming the repeater list is required for DR mode operation. (AI sec. 9)
• Before operating in the DV mode, be sure to check whether the access repeater is busy, or not. If the repeater is 
busy, wait until it is clear, or ask for a “break” using a method acceptable to your local procedures.
• The transceiver has a Time-Out Timer function for digital repeater operation. The timer limits a continuous trans-
mission to approximately 10 minutes. Warning beeps will sound approximately 30 seconds before time-out and 
then again immediately before time-out.

The transceiver includes a status message in the signal 
received back from the access repeater, after transmit-
ting.
Shows “UR?”

The call was successfully sent, but no station’s signal 
was received within 3 seconds.
The called station may have missed your call, so after 
waiting for a while, try calling again.

D
D
The destination repeater was not found, there is a pro-
gramming error, or the destination repeater was busy.
When “RPT?” is displayed, after waiting for a while, try 
calling again, because in a gateway call, your signal is 
sent even if the destination repeater is busy.
NOTE: “RPT?” or “RX” is displayed when:
• The repeater call sign programming is in error.
• Your own call sign is not registered on a gateway re-
peater, or the registration contents is not matched.
• The destination call sign is not registered on a 
gateway repeater, or the registration contents is not 
matched.
• The destination repeater call sign is not registered 
on a gateway repeater, or the registration contents 
is not matched.
• The destination repeater cannot be accessed.
• A blank MY call sign memory is selected. (“RX” is 
displayed)
Shows “L”

While operating in the voice communication or low-
speed data communication mode through the internet, 
some packets may be lost due to network error, or the 
caller’s signal is weak getting into the repeater. In such 
a case, “L” is displayed to indicate that Packet Loss has 
occurred.
When the transceiver receives corrupted data, and 
misidentifies it as Packet Loss, “L” is displayed, even 
if it is a Local area call.
Indicates packet loss
“L” blinks while packet 
loss is occurring.
This means that your local area call was cor-
rectly sent from the “Hirano” repeater.
This means that your gateway call was correctly 
sent from the “Hirano” repeater to the “Hama-
cho” repeater.
This means that your gateway call was sent 
from the “Hirano” repeater to the “Hamacho” re-
peater, but the “Hamacho” repeater was busy 
at the time.

Installation notes
For amateur base station installations it is recom-
mended that the forward clearance in front of the an-
tenna array is calculated relative to the EIRP (Effective 
Isotropic Radiated Power). The clearance height below 
the antenna array can be determined in most cases 
from the RF power at the antenna input terminals.
As different exposure limits have been recommended 
for different frequencies, a relative table shows a guide-
line for installation considerations.
Below 30 MHz, the recommended limits are specified 
in terms of V/m or A/m fields as they are likely to fall 
within the near-field region. Similarly, the antennas may 
be physically short in terms of electrical length and that 
the installation will require some antenna matching 
device which can create local, high intensity magnetic 
fields. Analysis of such MF installations is best consid-
ered in association with published guidance notes such 
as the FCC OET Bulletin 65 Edition 97-01 and its an-
nexes relative to amateur transmitter installations.
The EC recommended limits are almost identical to 
the FCC specified ‘uncontrolled’ limits and tables exist 
that show pre-calculated safe distances for different an-
tenna types for different frequency bands. Further infor-
mation can be found at http://www.arrl.org/.
• Typical amateur radio installation
Exposure distance assumes that the predominant ra-
diation pattern is forward and that radiation vertically 
downwards is at unity gain (sidelobe suppression is 
equal to main lobe gain). This is true of almost every 
gain antenna today. Exposed persons are assumed to 
be beneath the antenna array and have a typical height 
of 1.8 m.
The figures assume the worst case emission of a con-
stant carrier.
For the bands 10 MHz and higher the following power 
density limits have been recommended:
	10–400 MHz 	
2	W/sq m
	
435 MHz 	 2.2	W/sq m

In all cases any possible risk depends on the trans-
mitter being activated for long periods. (actual recom-
mendation limits are specified as an average during 6 
minutes) Normally the transmitter is not active for long 
periods of time. Some radio licenses will require that a 
timer circuit automatically cuts off the transmitter after 
1–2 minutes etc.
Similarly some modes of transmission, SSB, CW, AM 
etc. have a lower ‘average’ output power and the as-
sessed risk is even lower.
